little eye right above my head before we get going here let's jump in all right we got the board all set up here we have everything out here in the camera except our tokens are off camera to make a little room and we are ready to go and Joel's first player alrighty I am going to take my first action to go to this mountain which means I get this I believe and this it is good to be the first player maybe you should have gone hiking last week did you hiking last week I did about a week and a half ago oh well in that case no like I went yesterday I get the water from the weather apparents gonna go right there I get two Sun I get two Sunshine from there and your turn okay I'm gonna come here and give your guy a little kick and use my campfire up which lets me go to the same space as you per your own instructional video yeah um plug means I get two no why am I taking from here taking it from your hand uh I get two you're new but you can't cheat two stars all right I'm gonna slide right here take this water okay and I will spend three poor choice drowning poor choice take the I have a permanent parks cost one less Mountain to visit I'm gonna take my front man I said in here man he's the front man for the group I'm gonna grab my water canteen which means I get a tree basically treat and then I get another tree and you get it for the space right there yep okay well these are very Christmasy kind of Trace they are I want to decorate okay cool I only remember to replenish this gear card real quick here they replenished earlier we are on to my turn and I think I am going to go here in my campfire and I will get a tree in your room man I don't know I'll grab some more Suns let me go up and grab a Mountain hear it what does this do you take a picture you can spend two tokens take a picture at your point in the game and you steal the camera or you can draw a new canteen card to a permanent canteen you can keep your canteen in a new permanent canteen card a second one yeah I'll go do that sure yeah right there all right my new canteen um has a bear or a park I don't know the Bears are wild or you can reserve a bird can I fill it immediately I was gonna look at that pretty quick it says Phila canteen by placing a water filled this term hey if you went you can put that water in your can get the action you can't do that I really all right I will do here I'm gonna reserve a park that's what that hand means right that stinks and I'm gonna pull this part down and turn inside please remember you observed it is there any way for you to get that back no it's mine for lately yours so I'm the biggest winner ever you're the biggest winner I'm gonna go here get this and I'm gonna get two water you're out okay I'm gonna move up one take another wood there I'm gonna go here I'm going to build a park and I'm going to do this one right here it costs a tree a water and a sun if you're fill right away in Europe can multiple people build a park yeah so these actions anyone can take anyone can take them first person here gets to go first Mark our next turn first question here gets a discounted gear I'm gonna move here and I'm going to reserve this part oh nice for myself it's gonna be the Mountain Man For Me Myself and I yep all right I'm gonna take a step forward two Sons Europe alrighty um I'm gonna give up all right I'll move on here with you I will also build a park and I'm gonna build this uh Shenandoah National Park established 1935 Jacqueline DeLeon we can't do this every time yes we can technically both of us have a new camper okay and I will spend the cost for it and what's this number mean figure points into the game oh okay and then I have to be worked now to the end of this so this one immediately you said yeah he's taking action still I will take this action and get one discount I want to build this gear card cost me one so we're gonna move our people back to the beginning of this do I replenish my flame yes and my canteen's empty again yes two empty canteens okay and do I take all your resources no that one did no I took a picture my picture was this thing I can't see you guys so small oh that's a picture of my Park you're gonna have to um add in a random Advanced one mix them all together and the trail just got one step longering in the season of growth you can gain a boom if you have if you gain any wood Ganon explosion anytime you can would the sun is explosion Sam it looks like an explosion it does it really does it really looks like an explosion all right so you're so first player this one right here says that you may spend a water to copy an action of any hiker including mine or you're at any other site so it's useless on the first turn it's uses a really bad spot for that one or we got a weather pattern put out there and Joel's still first trying to take it from him alrighty I will jump to here and take this and I will spend this and this um so a bang and a bang two eggs um for a picture okay so you get take a picture out of the box so I just take a picture do I are they all the same all the same on the same yep okay and you get a camera now on camera no don't look at my picture when we go to here I'm going to grab the canteen card full all right oh you fool alrighty uh I'm gonna just move One Step Up all right and I'm going to take this bang and two more bangs Okay I'm going to jump ahead to this one and get water water I'm gonna put two of those Waters onto here and we'll get two suns and a mountain I'm just gonna hop over you and take a star and a mountain a mountain are you you're probably close to 12 tokens I'm assuming no I don't want to have that limit everyone has limits all right I'm going to go here I will spend a water and I will copy the action of you and get a mountain and assuming that mountains are going to start coming out I'm gonna go here and I'll use my fire take two water okay I'm going to put it up here get a while and I'm going to get a Wild Buck I'm gonna go here take the camera away from you sorry take a picture and I'm going to spend two okay two waters I'm gonna go here to my park okay I'll buy St Louis St Louis Arch nice I will have him jump to the end I'm gonna buy this new part just came out the Channel Island National Park all words and I can say it cost me one water you suck because I have a couple gear cards oh those are the big ones I want all right and I'm the first one to the end which means nothing's identity first player throw from you so you're oh I actually got this water don't wanna play this game go in here oh I we lit my campfire and I went to the end so I'm going to jump ahead get a treat get a tree your turn oh I get it I was narrating I won't I won't complain if you want to give me a tree trick or treat ah cool I will build a park I'll build this it's a pretty good one yeah it's dump on here it's pretty good do I have to pay the cost for that you should I'm gonna just jump to the end I will Reserve this big boy right here and before doing that first I am the first player next time hear me I'm gonna come here and I before you do you can choose that one too take a look what's coming up tough choices right there I feel like that one's just cheaper though for three it's not four coins very close I think it's just a better deal okay cool that's a great picture right there I love the way that one looks yeah it's really cool actually then move back to the beginning uh personally the camera has a photo opportunity get over yourself opportunity I'm gonna shockingly use a mountain to do that because strategy don't ask why we're gonna pick them all up okay and then we're just gonna set out these first again for the Arts and we do a new weather pattern all right so we're waiting for the third season we've been for game totally did not do the weather apparently to take the bonus right there so if that happens sometimes it scans just a little but one more detail pay attention to do so if that bothers you I am profusely sorry no you're not I'm a little sorry you're proud of what you've done I'm a little sorry you're proud of what I'm a little done I'm going to jump to this one right here I will grab a sun and do my thing I'm gonna get two waters fill both the canteens and get two sons in the mountain you're up all right I'm gonna jump past you I'm gonna get this one I will take another why is that a dolphin nice oh maybe a killer whale I'm gonna jump all the way to this park zone here because this is just too good all right I'm gonna go here okay three more of these now that I know about my endless handle in it let me go here let me go here I'm going to spend a sun and take another photo I'm gonna go here and I will pop that water there for a tree and another Montana go here and we get it Wild for the first time I get a bat okay I'm gonna go here and get two water all right I'm gonna go here and get a sun and a tree I'm gonna go here and use my campfire you are allowed to do that is that any better than just getting in the wild though it's actually worse because you're further along the track so I'd probably do the opposite I should probably do the wild I was just thinking that'd be funny it's been a while since I played so I have those answers like previous like I don't know I probably makes sense so if I'm wrong just tell us in the comments YouTube interactions I want to buy this Olympic National Park you want to spend my two trees I'm gonna spend my bat okay I'm gonna move here and build do that part well I guess I'll do that part let's go do that Park oh my goodness wow five it's Yellowstone Forest it's the yellow it's yellow it's the yellow it's the Yellowstone the Yellowstone I hear there this is kind of a lesser known fact but there's a geyser it goes off consistently I would say it's not consistent but it's reliable is it new or has it been there a while it's pretty new it's not old no it's brand new it's not old I'm gonna jump over you okay let's come and grab another campfire another wood okay I'm just going to do that into my campfire get a wood I'm going to invest in real estate I don't know what I want to do I'm gonna build the Great Sand Dunes National fan I'm going to build it's your turn again I love that's my favorite picture I think oh that was really good too I really like that one you picked though this one here um and okay if I'm gonna build one more um shoot I was gonna build this but honestly I just can't pass up I wish I could have built that I don't think I want to pass it up right Five Points is it okay so do I lose if I don't get my goal at the end of the game no that's going so it's just bonus one so if like I haven't had anything like if I haven't had a good opportunity for it at all so like if I just don't get it it's it'd be better just to not that big to go for bigger Parks mine is really not even close there's only two points so it's not worth that much even um I go first you take the first marker again no I just took it for me to be funny all right last season I'm just gonna take a step forward here and take a photo with that here get another photo so do you have a goal around getting photos or do you just like the point I might have a goal that has to do with photos and it's also free points I'm gonna go here and get a star and a wood okay if anyone's a die-hard fan of this game in your comments they're gonna be so mad at my titling I'm gonna get a start they're like it's sunlight so I take a step forward into my campfires I've had to flip over I'm gonna move right here I will grab this water here for an extra wood nice nice okay I'm going to I think I'm just going to jump here and get a water and two more Waters and I'm going to my typical move where I put doing a canteen activated canteen do two sons and oh Mountain that made of a stick yes no I didn't make a mistake okay I did make a mistake okay I I thought this was just Reserva park because I would definitely rather grab a wild than okay than that right yeah it just makes sense right it just makes sense put it together it just makes sense yeah all right I'm gonna take a step forward okay I will snag this water and go ahead and do my wood this turn doesn't really matter in the end I guess and I still get a wild you get a wild kit so I guess I'll take a mountain no no you get a wild even better get a wild wild oh yes I keep thinking they're like it's a pick any get a wild as in a wild wow a while oh I live in a while why you ain't seen a while till you see my face I'm gonna go to this one I'm going to reserve I want to buy I want to reserve I'm gonna buy I'm gonna do this park right here actually oh nice so this is my I get a discount on this this I'm sorry I just kind of Mount this bag at this and I get wait two water and then two trees I'm just gonna move here and grab a wood move here I will get a sun if I'm going to trade out two suns for two trees I'm gonna go here I'll take this water and the mountain okay I'm going to jump to buy a park and I'm going to buy the mountain mountain tree tree window there's actually a discount Mountain so Mountain treater oh did you want that one you knew that's what I wanted I did not I I tried to reserve it I knew nothing whatever okay I'm gonna take a step forward and buy a park so you don't buy another one around front of my feet I really need that one dramatic I'm gonna go here and get his son and two more Sons I'm gonna take this water okay and I want to use it to reuse this action and so let me buy this perk yeah I think I want to jump here and I'll trade out that makes sense no where was that yeah Mountain I'm gonna take a step forward and get a wild so here I will trade out two suns for two mountains um I'll take a step forward and get two stars from two stars and help me so I might as well just easily get all the actions you want at the end of course when we go here it's going to spend those four Mountains for those four points yes so it's all I can do okay okay so at this point I might as well get all the stuff to weigh all my options and get to well I mean I've got to hold everything honestly so I ran to the end too quickly so he has all the time in the world right now well I guess I should go if I go in with him yeah right yeah then I have the opportunity to look at what's next does that make sense to you do it okay so I'm gonna move in here to the final buy a park space and I want to buy this but I think it's just more economical to buy yeah Yes actually this one probably because you don't reveal something if you buy that one oh that's what I wanted to do that's what I said right before this and I I forgot thank you all right so I'm gonna buy that with a a tree and sorry a tree and two mountains okay so I flew out this last one okay I can do it all you need I can do it no I can do it yeah that's why I did it this way so I can get the two for one on a mountain so you need mountains yeah those are really good so I need to get mountains then I can find two for one so one for one two times so you get two mountains I guess I'll get two mountains yeah okay then I move in here oh that's so cool I don't think I could get it sorry I got excited and I'll hold on to my dolphin because I think it's cute oh that'll move to that last place I'll take Mount Rainier National Park right now here I did one more photo opportunity and that is the game we just need to add up score okay baby okay our players reveal their year cards okay so here's the way it works the player with the most points at the end is the winner the rule book says that that's crazy um okay so we're just gonna add up our cards first of all I have 26 what do you have 31 okay then I get one bonus for this in 28 29 30 31 32 334 35 and you have 30 four I didn't get that I didn't have this you have 30 oh it's like a plus one and I also got my lower Gold All right so that was my first play of parks and I heard really well I think this game is really interesting that the core mechanisms like do you want to jump way ahead of them get through stuff you really want or do you risk it when you use your campfires it's a nice fun light right pretty quick game yeah it's pretty cool the movement's really interesting going first and taking pictures is a lot more powerful than I thought I figured I could just not do them yeah they're pretty cool that's dumb I had all these resources I am dumb thanks for watching Parks Joel is dumb if you did enjoy the video we do have a lot more playthroughs on the channel so if you click subscribe and also liking the video If you enjoyed it really makes us happy I don't know if it helps us out but it makes us happy and if it wasn't clear on
