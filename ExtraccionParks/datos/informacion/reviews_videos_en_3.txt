hello welcome to bad at board games he's bad at working i'm lumberjack brad and i'm aura and i guess you picked her side that's not very nice of you [Laughter] we're here to talk to you about parks if you've seen our top board games for couples you will notice spoilers that that was on this list and now we're going to talk about this so this is from key master games by i'm going to get it wrong henry audubon and the artwork is done by a lot of different artists so that's probably one of the reasons it's such a looker so what do you think about how this game looks i love the way it looks um i like all the little drawings on all the little cards i'm a big fan of the national parks i would love to visit them all and i'm working very very slowly towards it and i just like how different each of them are and they're unique to the parks i feel like it captures them in a really colorful wonderful way um and the little tokens they're nice they're like wood and they're you know nicely colored they feel good the the little picture tokens are cute um they all have nice little pictures on them as well um it's an adorable camera um yeah i i love the way it looks and i know you love the the way that the box itself looks with with the storage yeah so this is the first time i've had game trays in a game um and this this is slick like everything fits in a home and you if you can't see but it's even got like a tree bark texture right on the clear plastic when they did the thermal forms they they put little symbols on it so you actually know what goes in there like where the camera goes there's a little camera in the thermal form piece the the engineering that went into that i really appreciate thank you yes even the little the first player token it's like it's metal it's nicely painted it's got a glaze like the little meeples that have like hikers backpackers put on to them i mean there was a lot of a lot of really great thought and artistry that went into this um i don't know who the artist is well the art oh that's what i say yeah these are all these are different artists oh they are i don't know if they're all different but like there's several artists that went into um being used in this game yeah it's it's great it's great yeah so if you've never played this game it's there's another game that's trails if you're kind of like don't want to spend i think this game is like 35 to 50 i can't remember exactly where it was but if you don't want to spend that much they have another game trails go check out that link should be right here or something i'm trying to get people to go over there yeah anyway but that gives you an understanding of what this mechanic is so that's a little bit easier than this and if you if you're kind of like unsure you want to spend this much go check out trails and then if you like it i guarantee you're going to want to buy this so it's kind of like much better yeah so that's like and that's you're trying to figure out where you're spending your money right so if you're like not sure on the nature side of things and you just want something check trails out if you like that mechanic you're going to like this and speaking of mechanics how's this work you've got your trail hikers here and you're going to move down the trail and as you get to a spot you're going to get resources sun or water or mountains and you're going to be able to reserve your spot in a park well you reserve it and then you use the tokens to buy yeah and it's there's a whole thing yeah and i don't think they call it buying and that's why i said yeah you visit it you get the business everyone so that's that's the game and then as you visit these parks you get picture points and so it's a victory point game but it's the journey that you're taking and i like the added uh ability at the bottom there are these cards that you can purchase with the suns um you know at the end of the trail you'll learn more about that as well um i like that because it will have things like oh you can visit a park for one less tree you can visit a park for you know one less sun whatever so when you get those it makes it easier to actually get the other and everybody has their own strategy i think that's the strategy i tend to go towards more so than you do um and you like taking pictures and i like taking pictures yeah um i'm about trying to get those things um it works though because i think i've beat you the last couple of times i don't know where we are on sport but i feel like i've had more wins than lost you've had more ones i think it's almost 60 40 or 70 30. yeah some something like that maybe we'll find out we will post the steps because if i'm really ahead i want you to i want that out there for everyone so talking about the theme it's it's not painted on um this theme actually works with the game and like how how you would be out in nature right the trails get longer so it's played over four different turns and just like when you go out hiking you're going to start with short trails and then you're going to get more advanced more advanced more advanced so this has four seasons and she was one that commented oh and i was saying like oh the trail gets longer on the second round and the third round the fourth round she goes oh it's just like well yeah like if you're if you're hiking you tend to start with oh i'm gonna do this one hike it's gonna be you know over so many days and it's gonna be 20 miles and then the next time you guys can be over this many days and it's going to be that many miles and even when you're on like a multi-day hike um you don't normally want to do the the most of your miles at the beginning especially because you're more slipping back that's like more of a camping but um all that to say not painted on the theme the thing is they've integrated that into the game itself they seem to know a lot about uh the parks nature hiking yeah um they'll leave no they even have at the bottom um the leave no trace and it talks about yeah the different they incorporate that into the game i'm like that's awesome my nature queen over here she's like so but really nice game on that side so what do you think of our gameplay like some of the games can you tell what have you enjoyed about playing so i have it's different playing at two player versus three player um and a lot of that is because if you are going to be on a campsite one of these little places with someone else um you have to use your fire and you extend extinguish your fire you only get one of those per round so the more players you have the more hikers campers are on the trail they start taking up they start taking up space it gives you less opportunity to move around it makes the game harder and harder also going back into the you know hiking camping principles it's harder to enjoy the more people that are on the train yeah your reference what was the appalachian trail appalachian yeah the hiking appalachian there especially right now um it's been you know more and more populated it does make it more difficult for a multitude of reasons but um yeah it's so i like the fact that you can see that right there in the game so what was it that like i brought this out and what was your first thought when i first brought this my first thoughts was uh it was you wanted to find something that you knew i would enjoy because it has things about perks um and i think it was really tired it's a common theme brad likes to pull games out at the end of the day after i've been at work and he's like let's learn a new game and so i was like okay well it was it was really easy to figure out how to play it um because i think we started with with the survey trails and that was easy to pick up and then this one just elaborated on it and it didn't take very long pulling this one out from the other one that i was like okay i really like the improvements on this one over the other game it sparked more a lot more interest for me yeah yeah so that's why i'm like if you like if you like trails you'll one that will be easier to learn this and two this brings out more strength so it's it's just a you know it's a it's a one notch up the ladder and it it makes it really enjoyable i i these are games that i would have never thought i would enjoy you know honestly and after playing tram like this is a really cute little game and so then i i really wanted to get this and then after having it and see how nice the components are and everything this is a stellar game keymaster top great game great game i continue this is our third key this is our this is our second key master game we now have three and we're probably gonna have four or five because i'm i'm enjoying the quality and i'm enjoying enjoying the mechanics of the party you want to try more things and it doesn't take that long this is a you know a 30 minute game um i think even when we had three players it might have been the 40 minutes maybe and i know it says 40 to 70 minutes we haven't seen it take that or if it has it's it's gone by that yeah it hasn't felt like that long yeah and one of the things with it going through and playing it and seeing the pictures of the different parts realizing how many there are and realizing how many i have yet to visit i think playing it i get a little bit of like a little fomo like i need to go to this place why are we not here right now yeah no so what would you rank this so at a out of 10 what would be your ranking oh it's somewhere like a seven or eight and only because i feel like the other okay i'm gonna say seven only because like it's a fun game you can play it really easily i it's one of those you're going to get some of it's going to have to do with luck some of it's going to have to do there's not as much strategy there is some strategy don't get me wrong but so much more of it has to do with the luck of the draw and stuff like that i think there are some other ones that spark my interest just because there's room for me to grow room for me to learn you can you manage the strategy instead of the randomness exactly yeah yeah but this is fun yeah so i'm gonna say this comes in at about a seven for me as well i like playing this i like playing it as a two-player game and we the other person we brought it out to for a third was new to board games and and she liked it really well yeah like really really she was going to like crazy how are you so good at this like she's barely even played games yeah and you know this is definitely can be something that you can bring other people into just because of the appearance and how it plays and it's like oh i get that i understand that people can pick it up pretty quickly so you know this is another intro game into the hobby and it's gorgeous and has all those little things that can kind of like come to the dark side so my rating seven her rating seven any final thoughts uh no check out my video or here that linked it you're not giving that up right now you're gonna have to watch the video now you know you want to you watched it first it's gonna be a good one i hope we'll see you have a great night no you don't want to tell them have a great day good night it could be morning good afternoon good evening good night bye [Music] you
