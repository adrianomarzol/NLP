welcome back to the channel everyone today I'm going to be doing my review of parks now Parks is a set collection game this game's been out for quite some time it's been very popular um so in this game you're playing as the as hikers here you have your little these hiker meeples here which are really cool and you're gonna have these little Trails here laid out Acro along the board along the board here but what you're doing is you're going to these different locations and collecting the resources that are on these spots of course and you know you competing against other players there's also Soul mode uh the components on this game are freaking beautiful especially with the Arkansas as you're collecting these resources you're using those resources to visit there's a different national parks that are laid off laid across the board here and the art on them is just again stunning fantastic everything component wise in this game is is beautiful so in moving along these these parts there and you also have these like things on your backpack so now these now these little these items on your on these backpack cards they help you again uh start collecting more stuff so like this for example parks cost less water to visit um along the along the line you're gonna be taking pictures of some of these uh pots which will give you more excuse me more points at the end of the game um yeah it's very very simple but here's my problem with the game it is just far too light way too light and for me there is going to be a lot of people who are going to be enjoying this game but for somebody like me who's into more you know a little more heavier stuff more deeper strategy I just really wasn't feeling I played this game twice and I just like after the second time I just didn't want to play it again again it's not a bad game it's again a lot of people gonna have a lot of fun with it as you can see the art and the components are fantastic Key Master games makes also again they made Caper Europe which is one of my favorite two-player games of all time um but it's just you know again there are expansions with it but I don't know I just I don't feel like going back to it it's it just didn't intrigue me enough to want to go back it's again I feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again I visit these places collect these resources uh get the car there are a ton of cards in this game you know there's a ton of national parks again every single one of these looks looks fantastic but it's I mean it is a nice relaxing game I I want to compare to what like wingspan is one of the more one of those like like games you just want to chill there's not much like take that or interaction it feels like a solo game the only thing you're really doing is taking a card from somebody else or you know maybe blind one not really blocking their way but you know I'd much rather play wingspan if I'm gonna play something that's you know light or relaxing and again it is a light relaxing game but again it's it's just samey and it's just too light for me uh at the end of the day this game is going to get I'll get I'll give it a six out of ten only because I like the components a lot uh again it's not a horrible game it's just you know way too light for my taste um I can see why it's popular again if I'm gonna play a light game I'd rather play Cascadia or I'd rather play wingspan those games have much more strategy much more depth in them I didn't feel I had that with this game but uh it's going to be leaving my collection so I'm actually going to be doing a video on that but uh yeah you know it is what it is I could see like I say don't believe the hype but I can see why it is popular but yeah it's a six out of ten uh please like And subscribe if you have any comments questions about this game feel free to ask me um you know subscribe to this channel it means a lot to me it'll help this little little Channel grow come you know get better equipment with it and start doing better videos make playthroughs and stuff but uh yeah that's gonna be it for today guys uh so that's Parks six out of ten yeah I wanted to like it but yeah you know it is what it is can't like everything but anyway have a great one guys until next time
