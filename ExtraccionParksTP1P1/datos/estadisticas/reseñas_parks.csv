7.2,"Some of the best production I've seen in a game. Just beautiful. The game itself is simple but enjoyable. Fun solo mode, despite not having a won/lose condition. Lacks depth without the Nightfall expansion."
7.3,"I love the National Parks. The art in this game is amazing. Pieces are also fantastic. However, I do fell that one needs at least 3 players for the best time with it. Two players is not bad, but could be better.
I will be selling this version once 2nd Edition arrives."

6,"This game looks pretty, it is honestly just a bit confusing. I think there is some intense meta, but a little too much randomness for me."
8,"The production of this game is beautiful, and the gameplay is simple and relaxing. However, this is one of those games that I just wish the replayability was just a bit better."
8,"If you enjoy the outdoors and appreciate the national park system this game is for you. Gorgeous art on each card representing a specific national park. Gather resources, visit parks and collect them for the points listed on each."
8.8,"I love the simplicity and beauty of this game, it's eye candy and doesn't overstay its welcome. Great little resource conversion puzzle with a bit of push-your-luck thrown in. Feels good when you can finish the last round with just enough resources to visit the parks you need."
7.2,"A game that I never want to play, but when I do, I'm like, ""Damn, that's a great game""."
6,"A really beautiful game that's just a little bit too long. I regret getting rid of this game because I think it could have become one of my favorites but, I would rarely play it with 3 players (the ideal player count).

I can always get a game in on BGA."
7,Excellent integration of theme and game. Game play is a bit scripted on number of meaningful choice you can make.
6.8,"The Good:
+Artwork and graphic desgin is pretty to look at.
+Variable game board leads to lots of replayability.

The Not So Good:
-Stripping away the theme, it boils down to being a contract fulfillment game where the challenge is imposed on players not being allowed to backtrack on the trail, urging a sense of first-come-first-serve. You take a turn to take resources, and later you turn those in for points. There are plenty of games that do this in more interesting ways
-They shoehorn in alternative ways to earn resources, such as trading your water for another resource, which seems rather abstract for the theme, but take that how you will.



Solo Mode:

For a pick-up-and-grab experience with a somewhat predictable automa, there's a handful of other solo games I'd rather play. The activity of moving pieces and picking up items is a fairly lackluster experience playing on your own. This game definitely thrives on outsmarting your opponent and not knowing what is getting picked. However a system that dictates how the automa moves loses the unpredictability factor.

The fact that the Solo mode instructions are placed after the Credits makes this seem like an afterthought.


Other Thoughts:
-If you don't have a contract fulfillment game and you want one that's not terribly dry, pleasant to the eyes, this could be for you. If you've reached a point in this hobby where you value the quality of the game's design (mechanisms, ideas, balance, and less about visual aesthetic), there are more interesting options out there."

(BGA being removed 2024-08-14, SO SAD!; new edition in alpha Feb 2025)"
9,Enjoy playing the base game repeatedly. Have expansions but haven't felt the need to integrate. This is a good medium game accessible and playable by non-gamers. Not sure why this really needed a 2nd Edition with mechanics changes other than maybe trying to drive $'s.
8,"Only played solo so far. It is one of the rare games that I don't want to play without an expansion (nightfall). The only other is Raiders of the North Sea.

Inability to regain the camera in solo is frustrating especially if your private goal is to have photos. Maybe I will omit those goals in solo. Without the expansion, I would rate this, for the solo at least, as a 5. The goals in the base game are too difficult and not satisfying. The expansion replaces the goals and are generally more achievable.

For solo, I consider a score of 25+ a win based on score ratings in the instructions."
7,Surprisingly fun with many interesting decisions that will appeal to non-gamers and longtime gamers alike.
8,"Fun game, very Zen but you can play it competitive too if you want to go that route."
5.5,"You move through a trail collecting goods that you trade in for small powers or points. A fairly simple mechanic that is accessible to everyone and has some nice art, however it is quite repetitive and comes with no variants so the game is not that fun. Even after just one play at two players, I wasn't really interested in playing again. After a second play, this time at five, the feeling was the same and the game is much too long at larger player counts."
8.5,"Beautiful art and a great game. Relaxing and not stressful, very fun"
8,"Beautiful track movement game

,"Excellent condition. This version not compatible with the ""Wildlife"" expansion - although the 2nd edition is compatible."
8,"Rating has gone up to 8 w the wildlife expansion, which has especially improved the two player experience. Nightfall on the way."
8,"This game is...relaxing. Instead of tense or cut throat - I just feel like I'm taking a pleasant journey each time. There's nothing earth shattering to the mechanics, but they just work. The production value is top notch with the artwork and game insert."

3.8,"Absolutely gorgeous artwork and a beautiful production. The different cards showing national parks always leads to a conversation of having visited or wanting to visit that location. The games mechanics however are very dull. You land somewhere, you take a resource, you spend resources to buy cards. The tile placement is way too random for any real strategy, the starting end game goals and canteen cards are a crapshoot in terms of how powerful they can be. A game that is absolutely not for me."
8,"The one player variant wasn't bad but I feel that the ""park ranger"" role really rushed me through it! I think it'll be far more enjoyable with people trying to score the most points!

Edit: After a multiplayer game, it was definitely less rushed but increased pressure to get your strategy right."
6.7,"A little underwhelming, but a nice package as usual from keymaster."
8.5,"A nice quick filler game that I always enjoy at games night. Beautiful art work, easy to teach, and light strategy."
7,Perfectly fine lightweight game. Offers enough strategy to keep it interesting without being an absolute brain burner. Artwork is stunning.

1-5 P, 30-60, 2.12

Available on Tabletopia and TTS.

Watched (at least part of) a play through video on 11/14/22. I wasn't impressed with the official solo mode.

""it's really quite a mean and blocky tactical game if you play it at the right player counts.""

This is a lightweight strategy game. The most challenging decisions surround which camp site to move your hiker, when its the right time to grab a park and if you need to block the Automa (Park Rangers) from end of round scoring."
8.5,8.5 points with the Nightfall Expansion. 6 points without. The expansion is essential for me.
8,"Very peaceful, cozy game. Not very long, easy to pick up."
8,"There's no question the biggest appeal of Parks is the striking artworks and game pieces which do so much to pull you into its idealized wilderness theme. To me, at least, this makes up for what modest shortcomings may lie in the otherwise solid functional design."
8,"Parks seems as though it was never play tested with inexperienced players. The rules are complex, hard to remember, non-intuitive and poorly organized, making the game challenging to learn. We got it wrong so many times before we got it right. But, each game was satisfying none-the-less.

The game always starts a little slow and gets more interesting by the 4th season. There are plenty of opportunities for house rules and modifications. So, we customized it to suit our fancy and to keep the game motivating for everyone. Eventually, we began to adopt most of the ""proper"" rules, but still keep a few house rules in-play.

The wildlife expansion is well worth purchasing and permanently adding to the base game (we don't play without it). Over time it has become one of our family favorites."
10,"What a fantastic, GORGEOUS game. Can't recommend it highly enough! Will add the highly recommended Nightfall expansion when I'm darn good and ready.

I ain't ready.

w/ Nightfall"
6,"Light and fun, nice change of pace from heavier board games."
7,"The game is beautiful with excellent components. The gameplay itself is... fine. Nothing revolutionary, easy to grasp and to teach, plays quickly. The game relies heavily on the great art and components, but the depth of strategy is very low and your decisions always seem obvious. Overhyped and overrated in my opinion. Not a bad game, just not a top 200 game of all time."
7,I like this game. The artwork is amazingly beautiful. The game moves a bit slow for me. You never want to fly through the trek as you will not have enough tokens to visit parks. Playing with two is much better to me than playing with three. Playing with three seems to have less spaces to accumulate tokens.
7,"First things first probably the best looking game I own. From the game pieces, to the cards, the board, and even the box. Everything is gorgeous. For whatever reason, my friends and I never grab this game or play it very often. None of us dislike it but we never want to play it and go for something else. Maybe it's the pacing or length of the game? That would probably be one of my complaints with it. Another one is I wish canteens and gear were more useful. The expansions help with this a little but in the base game it's too valuable to not focus on just grabbing parks.

Pretty solid game overall with great art, fun gameplay and maybe a minor pacing issue."
4,"It's fine? Definitely a beautiful box with 10/10 presentation, but the game doesn't really do anything for me.

EDIT: Yeah had another opportunity to play this and it's just a boring worker placement/resource collection and conversion puzzle hidden behind some of the most beautiful board game artwork out there. Worst of all, the thematic connections to hiking and visiting parks are mostly nonsensical, which is just such a missed opportunity."
8,"Gorgeous artwork is really a standout here, but the gameplay is equally good. The whole presentation from the components to the box is all stunning."
6,"TRADED IT! (for Import/Export)

Played once (albeit incorrectly), and was interested enough to pick up a copy in a trade a year later. Now that I've had more time to dive into it, I have to say that while it is a solid intro/family game, it got old quick.

The production is top notch with a unique (for it's time) theme in tight little box."
7.5,Very pretty game. Need to play it more before I make a more solid review.
6,"Wonderful art, and good components.

Fundamentally, it is a resource and set collection game.
Nothing new here, but the art and components boosted its rating a lot.

Great for people new into the hobby,"
7.5,"Beautiful artwork, solid game. Components are very nice, and I have a lot of fun reminiscing about past visits to some of the parks as I play. The game itself seems pretty average, however. Movement can feel restricted and leaving you little choice in what to do. The campfire mechanic certainly helps this, but doesn't quite do enough in my opinion. The photo thing seems kind of tacked on, but I like the gear cards.

Still, we've played this several times already and I am getting requests to play it again so it must scratch the itch of others more than me.

Edit : played with Nightfall expansion and it really helped out, in my opinion."
7,"It’s really simple and fun and relaxing. Also, since it’s real places, it makes me dream of travel."
9,"One of my favorite games of all time. The theme, artwork, and unique game are just awesome. The main downfall is how long it takes to play. A game like this should be 45-60 minutes tops but my plays always seem to go over this."
8.8,"Beautiful game, simple, and fun. I always feel good when I play this."
3,"Sadly, it consistently plays too long for what it is (90+ minutes) and even worse, each round becomes longer than the last. PARKS has an insufferable pace in which certain player counts create more ""railed"" choices on your turn and yet you can't ever really plan ahead because of how randomly the game state changes. Players score points through a generating/spending/generating again repetition. After returning to this again, I've lowered my rating. I don't find this exercise enjoyable even if I enjoy the artwork."
9,"This is one of the prettiest games you will ever open. Amazing artwork and the production quality is through the roof. This game is deceptively simple once you play it. I recommend either watching how-to videos or learning from someone who knows how to play.

Also the mechanic for how the hikers work is awesome"

8,"Before this was expanded, I thought it was an ok game. Beautiful, fun, but missing something I just couldn't quite articulate. My favorite part of this game was the artwork, not the game itself. With the nightfall expansion this has now jumped to a game I would suggest and enjoy playing more often."
9,"Board games and chill. Very beautiful, the art is sublime and a joy to discover each card as it’s revealed. It’s actually pretty relaxing which generally isn’t my cup of tea, but here the mood just fits the theme. There’s just enough conflict and decisions to keep things moving and engaging. Reminded me of Tokaido but actually fun. Think I prefer it at 2 but it’s fine at 3 as well.

The first expansion is fantastic, wouldn’t play without it though it’s not really essential.

Second expansion is just as good.

The end game tableau is so fun to look at."
6.5,"Beautiful cards, nice components, wonderful tray insert, relaxing and enjoyable game play. This is the type of game I want to play after a long difficult day."
9,"I was always so afraid to pick up this game thinking that it would be too light for my wife and I. I recently just got it for my birthday, and finally got the chance to play it. Long story short, I LOVE IT. Keep in mind, that I’ve only played once, but I do really think this game is a timeless classic, and can live in anyone’s collection for years.

With Keymaster, you already know you’re getting one of the finest produced board games available at retail - so its needless to say that this game is absolutely beautiful. The gameplay is incredibly simple, but at no time feels boring. The gameplay still requires brain power, and it does give you the tension and pressure to time things out against your opponents, or just race to the end so that you can collect points before it can be stolen from you.

It’s everything you could want from a light board game, but gives you the “feel” of something a little more mid weight in my opinion.

Absolute stellar game!"

-- the drawing of the bonus cards and park cards can be extremely luck-based"

It could have easily been just a few pretty cards on a mediocre board, but it is not. I also love the attention that went into the box and insert. Everything fits together in the box perfectly. Because of this, it is quick and easy to set-up and tear down.

As far as game play, while there is a bit to remember, (I made player aids) nothing is too difficult. I love the little combos you can create. I think figuring out how to set-up little combos is my favorite part of the game next to the art."

6,"A very reasonable game illuminated by stunning artwork. Not one that scratches any gaming itch for me, but it's beautiful and accessible, which is an ok combination"
6,"Enjoyed this with 3, but with 4 or 5 each game the player last in turn order seemed to repeatedly get sc####ed and had to finish early. Also you can not control turn order so arbitrarily you get to be last player."
9,"+ Wonderful, thoughtful themes and components
+ Actions are highly intuitive and easy to teach
+ Great learning experience, beginners seem to do just fine on their first plays"
7,"Simple gameplay, beautiful production, great theme. I love visiting the national parks in person, but this will have to do every now and then. The campfire mechanism is such an interesting addition to a straightforward, one way path game. Add in some set collection and you have one of my favorite family-weight games. Every game is such a pleasure.

Update: The expansion is fun and combo-tastic! Makes a great game even better. 8 -> 9

Ideal Player Count: 4 (adds an additional trail tile without overcrowding the trail)"
3,"love the artwork in this. tokaido-esque gameplay, you balance getting the most stops in, getting what you need, and blocking others from what they want. really kinda boring though, the art isn't enough to justify the mindless contract-fulfillment gameplay with zero arc to it at all"
7,"It's like Splendor, but with a theme I'm a lot more interested in + a sprinkling of new mechanics that make this a more complex game than Splendor. I hear the expansions make this game better so looking forward to trying those.

(Plays: 2)"
7,"This is a nice light game to play when you just want to experience some gorgeous artwork and have a nice hour or two with friends. It just scratches a nice itch and is an interesting take on worker placement. My wife very much enjoys this, and I am always up for a game when she suggests it."
5,Random canteens and weak objective cards could be improved. Nice theme and art and components.
7.6,"A zen-like game experience visiting parks and collecting the resources along the hiking trail in order to visit those parks. I've added Nightfall Expansion and with the YEAR cards upgraded I think this game gets a boost. I liked it quite a bit before the expansion, but I think after Nightfall it rises in my book."
9,Very fun and relaxing game. The art is amazing. Easy rules and turn mechanics. Strong solo play and multiplayer. Not a table hog. Buy this one.
6,"This would make a good, inoffensive gateway game. Not a lot of player interaction, appealing theme, cute bits, short gameplay. It's essentially gathering resources and spending them to ""visit"" (i.e. collect) parks to achieve bonus points through an end-game vp objective. You can also spend resources to take photos (1 vp each) along the way. It uses the same mechanic of Tokaido where you're moving along a linear track. Here each player has two workers, and there are not turnoffs along the way to stay at hotels."
7,"I have Nightfall, it is a must add in every game. It is a little long, but is beautiful, and enjoyable."
7,"Fast playing, mostly peaceful game of resource gathering but track makes you keep an eye on what you think opponents will do, not mean, not multiplayer solitaire either."
5,"Played it twice (first with no expansion, 2nd with nightlife expansion). The Nightlife expansion made it better but overall, it just didn’t feel that fun and exciting to play…There was some cool resource manipulation stuff tho and holy moly, the artwork is amazing! I sold it but if a buddy had a copy and wanted to play and there wasn’t any better options, i’d play it sure"
8,Grows on me the more I play it. The package is PERFECT.
7,"Its stunning artwork captures the beauty of national parks. The cards are visually captivating.

The ever-changing trails is refreshing."
4.3,"I'm not a huge fan of the movement (skipping over spots if other campers are there, unless you have an active campfire), and it seems like there aren't enough park cards out at a time to have enough good options at times, in my opinion. But the artwork is sublime and the individual, UNIQUE animal tokens are truly stunning."
6,"Didn't feel the need to return to it.
Beautiful components, but again, missing the spark of fun"
5,"This simple worker placement game features a wonderful production and elegant, streamlined gameplay that retains some great decision making!"
7,This is a fun light game with good artwork. It was a bit too simple for some of my friends but I still like it.
7.8,Fabulous art and theme playing out as a sort of more-competetive Tokkaido.
9,"Great game, beautiful art! Love that everything fits perfectly in the box, hate that it means I can't sleeve the cards!"
8,"Much better than its little brother Trails. Only one play so far, but i'm already hooked."
,"Urbana - nice theme, trails is card version, best at 2 players, has nightfall expansion"
7,"Parks sets up fairly quickly, plays smoothly, and has a relaxed sense of play. As with the destinations the game celebrates, the gameplay is open and free, yet still allows for deeper exploration (of strategies).

You and your fellow players are out to visit national parks, gathering various tokens that let you pursue VPs in a wide range of ways, though the most common is using the various weather tokens for claiming parks as visited by you.

While I quite enjoy the languid pace of play and the freedom to move my hikers at varying paces, the depth isn't tremendous. Save this for a time you want a less mentally taxing game with beautiful production and time to chat as you go.

Can you do more? Yeah, but why? Choices are limited in any given configuration, but there is solid replayability. Don't look here for a brain-buster, but don't sleep on the trail either. Being too laid back leaves you open to frustrating losses of opportunity as others snap up your targeted parks.

Packaging is beautifully efficient without leaving you guessing how to close the box each time, and it makes teardown time minimal. Expansions, however, rapidly multiply the time it takes to pack it up again."
8.5,"I love this game! It's been said before, but this has to be one of best uses of game box space. The inserts come right out onto the side of the board and have all the fiddly bits contained inside of them. I don't have to bag or unbag game pieces! Easy set up and take down combined with an excellent theme and beautiful presentation and mechanics. Why haven't you bought this yet?"

Really good for 5 players. Probably the best number of players. One of the mechanics is a narrow choice of available places to move, and you feel the maximum amount of it with 5 players.

It should be more free with fewer players. That's maybe not bad. But the idea of limited space is good, and I wouldn't want to waste this potential."

EDIT (9/02/24): Rating lowered from 7 to 6. Game scales poorly to 5. Gather resources, convert to VP cards (parks). Canteens and equipment push/pull on this. Very direct, but also very uneven. I really like the action selection mechanism, but it's so tight and dependent on the other players that it feels chaotic, particularly if you're at the back of the line (turn order). I understand that this evens out over the course of the game, but it still *feels* very uneven. Also a bit long for what it does - our 5p game took 2 hours. Bleh."
9,"I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would! I've grown a newfound appreciation for linear track movement. I liked the resource collection and track system a lot. The art is also gorgeous, of course. Everything comes together really really well. I'd definitely recommend this to people who aren't as familiar with board games, even if the teach can be a bit difficult as a lot of the cards rely on symbols. Regardless, I picked it up rather quickly and had a fantastic time. My only gripe was that gears and canteens felt a bit hard to acquire on my end, though my opponent Josie practically hoarded them, so I'm sure it's the fault of own play. The blocking mechanic was interesting too. I found it a bit annoying, but that was definitely by design. Led to some nice back and forth moments."

7,"+ Nightfall
+ Wildlife

Extraordinarily beautiful, light, worker placement game. Plays in a reasonable amount of time and increases in difficulty as more players are added. Am a big fan of slamming this on the table for 4 players as a filler game to kill 45 mins or so. Can't recommend it enough. At times I wish it had more substance for all that flash, will rate the expansions accordingly once I am able to try them to see if that improves the depth.

7,"Not the deepest game, but simple and quick to play, with gorgeous components and a great theme."
10,Played it at GenCon 2024 and it was insanely fun. The artwork is truly breathtaking and I will definitely be picking it up. I love the mechanic of placing the meeples down but having to continue moving forward. It adds a lot of cool strategy in building resources and making your moves.
8,"I love playing solo. And if my group understands this is a zen game, it's then fun in multi-player."
7.4,"It's a light game and I'm not too sure how much staying power it would have, but it's a fun game and looks great, with really nice production. Tempted to purchase with expansions."
7,"Beautiful, nature-y, lovely components. It can get a little same-y but the simplicity is good for playing with my kids. When I play with gamers, I recommend adding the Nightfall expansion for more goals and ways to score."
8,A beautiful game that's fun to play. Good strategy and player interaction but always leaves me wanting just a bit more. Otherwise a wonderful game. Always a winner.
5,"+ Beautiful art
+ Top-notch production in every aspect
+ Time track is fun

- Random cards in four different decks with synergies that can swing from really good to useless
- No way to mitigate that randomness
- No way to cycle the gear market when it goes stale
- Linear resource conversion is kinda dull
- Too long for the amount of randomness
- Lacks depth"
6,"(Solo play). Very beautiful game, but the gameplay itself didn't work for me. I will try to play with friends"
6,"I wasn’t expecting much from another lavishly produced but mechanically simple engine building/resource conversion game. But Parks did somewhat exceed my modest expectations. The action selection track is actually quite clever and interesting. The resource collection/conversion to VPs is very generic and uninteresting. The other stuff around this (canteens, gear, draw deck) are a bit random and swingy for my tastes. I don’t necessarily mind some randomness, but find it frustrating when some random rewards are just straight up better/more powerful than others, i.e. better in every situation vs better for a specific strategy/game state. This is my main criticism of both London and Ascension also. The game is short and light enough that my concerns don’t weigh too heavily against playing it but only from time to time and with the casualness that its weight and mechanics deserve. I’d put it a step above something like Splendor or Century in this genre though so I’m not too negative on it.. All in all, I’ll certainly end up playing again and be OK with that, though it is unlikely ever to be my top choice. Also, I find this better with fewer (that is to say 3) players."
6.5,"The artwork is absolutely gorgeous and the components are extremely satisfying. I would be willing to play this for that reason alone. That said, I think this is probably too random for me to enjoy playing when I am in the mood for a deep, complex game.

The worker placement mechanic using the one way trail is interesting. And I like that there is a way to share a worker space using the campfire mechanic.

There is a lot of downtime at even 4 players however. I think it would play longer than it's complexity deserves at any player count. And I worry about how cutthroat it might be at two based on other's comments."
8,"There's some strategy and a few interesting decisions to make, but this game really sings as a relaxing thematic experience. It's just a chill little puzzle. Very group dependent I would think."
8,"""Parks"" is a budget-friendly board game with stunning production quality. The game includes a custom insert and containers to neatly store all the components. The components are made of high-quality materials such as wooden meeples and a metal first-player marker. The artwork is super nice which adds to the theme of the game. The game features an engaging worker placement mechanism where players move their ""hiker"" along a path, strategically deciding how far to move in order to prioritize different actions. Overall, ""Parks"" is a fun and thematic game that I thoroughly enjoy.

Pros
- AMAZING production! I love the custom inserts, wooden components, metal 1st player marker, and card art.
- good game value (relatively cheap considering production).
- relatively easy to learn and teach.
- interesting gameplay

Cons
- Replay-ability: may get dry with numerous plays.
- The rulebook has a few confusing parts. I used Youtube to clarify a few rules. Not a big deal.

Overall, this game is stunning! I would probably rate the gameplay alone 7 out of 10, but due to the exceptional production, I have to rate it higher at 8 out of 10."
4,"There's some decent engine building stuff here, and I like the indirect player interaction, but I'm annoyed at the complete lack of thematic grounding. Like, what do the resources mean? What are we realistically competing over and why? It just seems like a very abstract game that happens to have pictures of natural parks in it. Not for me."
7.6,"Really enjoyable game with nice art, nice components, fun and quick tableau building."
7,"Seriously, this one is just gorgeous! The game is really light (and not necessarily something I'd have picked up if I hadn't received it as a present), but I think it does a nice job as a gateway game. Turns and actions are simple, the movement mechanic is fun, the variable path is nice to shake up strategy each season, and I like that there are secret goal cards. The base game feels a bit vanilla to me, but the expansions offer some nice additions that I think I will always add. It's a shame the base game box is too small to fit the expansions. I actually got rid of the awesome inserts in order to get everything to fit in the main box. Sadness."
10,"Such a relaxing game with a ton of replayability. Also love that there is a solo mode as I don't always have a group to reliably play with. The provided solo rules are fun, although the ""beat your own high score"" objective isn't very exciting for me. There are tons of other goals to set for yourself though, including visiting all of the parks, and not to mention the automa like Ranger Ron available (look it up). Beautiful art and very smooth gameplay. I upgraded to the neoprene playmat and I also bought a meeple upgrade kit from Etsy - both game changers. The expansions provide a great level of complexity without changing the core game - they are really great. In addition to more content, the expansions also fix a couple of issues with the base game - mainly the Year Cards. There is really only one thing I would change: I wish there were more Solo Cards. The ones provided are very cool and imaginitive, but the deck is so small and I feel like there could be so many more ideas incorporated."
5,"I guess this is fine for what it is - the artwork is definitely nice for the various parks. However, I find it extremely limiting at higher player counts and stressful to get what you need since you generally cannot go where anyone else is currently located. I find the later rounds to be a bit better since it has a few more spots available..but ultimately I just don't find the gameplay in this one exciting."
8,Solid little worker placement game. Plays quickly. Can be cutthroat or chill. Also have the Nightfall expansion that I will always include. Art work is fantastic. All plays recorded here.
7,First game played incorrectly and will play again for more accurate rating with expansion. Love the theme and artwork!
5,"A gorgeous little game with a nice flow and simple gameplay. Does feel like it plays itself as you're really limited by what appears in the Park and Gear marketplaces, so lucky draws can really favour some players over others and you kinda lose agency over victory or loss at that stage"
8,"can't score yet. RN the theme felt tagged on because it didn't work w/ the mechanism (why does it mean to spend 3 sunshine and 4 mountains to visit Yosemite? makes no sense) and more importantly, the rhythm felt off somehow"
8.9,"Having played multiple games, both solo and with others, I will say that PARKS holds its own with the game design that it provides. The game itself is beautifully designed with excellent artwork for each park card, each of the pieces are wonderfully crafted and the storage for the box itself is beautifully created to allow for a small overall box feel.

I do enjoy playing the game with others, but the random nature of the trails often makes it difficult to get the necessary parks for the yearly objectives if the ""Park/Equipment"" space is on the third or fourth trail. While not necessarily game-breaking, it does add some unnecessary difficulty to the game due to the random nature of the trail tiles.

The solo version of the game is decent but the (sometimes) over aggressive nature of the AI to finish the trail makes it more frustrating than anything. I have noted on several posts within the forum here on BGG, that many have noted that they have a burning hatred for park rangers after playing the solo version and I must say that I agree with the sentiment. While there are a few house rules that I have implemented on my solo playthroughs, there has not yet been a time where I haven't ended angry at the ""Rangers"" that ended my games too early.

All in all, this game is a beautiful addition to any collection and is absolutely worth it if you plan on playing with other people. I wouldn't buy the game for the solo mode only due to the aggressive AI nature, but it is a beautiful, well-designed addition to any game collection."

7.8,A beautiful and fun game that goes up a point in rating if you include the Nightfall expansion.
6,"Light, but gorgeous! It's definitely a great family level game and for new gamers!"
6,This game is so pretty and if you are a nature lover this is a must own and must play! It is basic resource collection to visit the parks but it one that I do enjoy to play

8,"So rich experience for solo play!! My new favorite!!!

Before having PARKS i’m stuck with wingspan for solo as i keep everdell and cascadia at my bf’s place for 2 players and everytime i feel like no better game to play then i play wingspan and i always feel forced, but PARKS is so much more enjoyable than wingspan!!! Every new round just feel refreshed! Instead of feeling being dreadful to repeat same actions

update after 10 plays - it's a soothing and quick game for solo before bed, but dont expect too much differences between games"
8,"Probably a 7 for gameplay, which is find but doesn't exactly rock your world. What a beautiful game though. I will never sell this because I love owning it as an object."

6.3,"Beautifully illustrated but mechanically simplistic, Parks is a solid addition to the burgeoning genre of light-ish family games with some Euro meatiness underneath. Pleasant but not Earth-shattering."
10,"This is a Tokaido killer. I liked Tokaido and loved the concept but everytime I played it new players at the table would get destroyed and give too much ground to seasoned players who know the value of taking your time with movement. Parks helps mitigate some of the min-max players by providing bonuses to those who first arrive on locations, providing a camp fire that can be used to share a location, and providing a second piece that can be used to help you stay on the track longer.

I should also mention the production is amazing, the box size is efficient, small, and practical and the art is fantastic.

The only complaint I have, and it is a small complaint, is that the mechanics don't really match the theme. You hike on an abstract trail to ""visit parks"" at the end of the trail, it just seems weird."
7.5,"Shame about the box cover and the duplication of name - otherwise it's a fun game

Does not seem very onerous....yet!"
8,"I play mostly solo, though I played once 2-player. I love the flow of this game. It goes at a nice pace, like a walk through the woods. And the artwork is just stunning. Beautiful components, and easy set up and take down with the inserts provided. This will be a regular on my game table."
10,Whenever I think of the game I just feel good. The ratchet mechanic for action selection and theme of visiting nations parks makes me feel joy from a board game.
7,"It’s okay. I own the game, but have only played a couple of times on BGA. Maybe I haven’t played against experienced enough players to see where the fun is?"
8,"10th Play Thoughts   8   (Nov 2020):

Still very much enjoy this game, and it has been a hit with many gamers and non-gamers. The artwork is incredible, theme is great, and it is easy to learn, but gives you a nice amount of meaningful decisions.

I think the first expansion, Nightfall, is definitely worth picking up if you enjoy the game. It vastly improves the objective cards from the base game, which were quite difficult to complete even if you were really trying, and not really worth many points. The other parts of the expansion are fine. I enjoy the extra park cards that are injected into the game. The campsite actions are situationally good, but the nice thing is, you can mostly ignore them and still do well. Would definitely recommend the game.

8,"This game delivered a far more satisfying experience than I expected. The actions were simple, but the order of action selection was very interesting. The only gripe for me had to do with end game scoring. It is very tight which means no one gets terribly left in the dust, but also the difference between the top three spots may be 1-3 points which makes it feel like pretty much any bad decision could tank your game. Overall, fantastic light weight, gateway game with a beautiful and accessible theme that will please almost anyone to whom you present it."
9,A family favorite. The artwork is gorgeous. I like it best with 3 or 4 players.
6,"As someone else stated, the gameplay is mundane. Choices are uninteresting and there's not really a lot of planning going on. The luck factor is high and cannot be mitigated. Art and visuals are excellent."

7.5,"Move along trails collecting resources, then cash them in when you visit national parks. Can feel a bit long with higher player counts given it's on the light side in terms of decision space, but I enjoy the rondel-like system and the relaxing feel, and the art and production is outstanding."
8,"A 7 based purely on gameplay, but the theme and aesthetic bump up my desire to play this game."
6.7,"I like this game. I think it works best at two, but it's a good game that I'd play more frequently since it's a quick one.
Don't know if expansions are needed."
8,Beautiful game. Best storage of pieces I've ever seen. Rules and gameplay are sound.
7,A resource management game that provides enough complexity to provide a thoughtful experience but never overwhelms with too many choices. A middle-weight game that has replaced Tokaido for me.
8,"Wow. Might be the prettiest and most well produced game I own. The creators didn't stop at pretty though. They made an engaging yet relaxing gateway game that is a joy to play. There aren't enough games that use the ""go as far as you want but you can't go back"" mechanism well."

Recommend: Yes. We’ve owned this game for about 4 years. It hits the table about once a year and it’s a shame bc it’s good quick and relaxing. If you are picking this up I recommend the following variant for the base game:
-Similar to end game goal start with 2 canteens and pick one to keep.
-last person off the trail removes a gear card from the 3 available and refreshes a new one to its place.
-each player starts the game with one wildlife token"
8.5,"Quite possibly the most beautifully packaged retail game that I've ever seen. This contract-fulfillment worker placement game combines resource management, a modular trail board and action-based track movement that provides multiple paths to victory based on parks visited, endgame bonuses and photos collected. The selection of parks, canteen bonuses and gear keep this fairly replayable. A family favourite."
8,A beautifully produced board game with fabulous artwork and thematic Eurogame. If you want more replay ability then add the Nighfall expansion for sufficient variety of options and strategies.
10,"This has been my favorite go-to-game as of late. It's the one I pull out every time someone new to gaming wants to learn. My 7 yr old can understand the rules and concept of the game and I'll be honest he's won me a few times. It can be a lot for new players to understand the rules so we play open rounds at first where I talk my turn so they can understand. Which is the best way to teach this one in my opinion. My non gaming parents, my mom shutters at the word ""game"" , played it the other night. While she was very impressed by my ability to learn all the ""rules"" and remember them, she enjoyed herself. And has been to 21 of the parks in the base game and wildlife expansion. It's a family game that everyone should own!!"
4,More art than game. The strategies are not mean enough to be interesting. Required play time is too long and life is too short. Might as well go to an actual park.
8,Resource management with unique theme. Dynamic changes each season as actions available changes. Takes longer the more people playing.

7.5,"Good game, easy to play once you learn. Mechanics feel very thematic. Everyone enjoyed it."
7,"I like the theme and the artwork very much. It is an easy to table and teach game, probably on the level as Splendor, but with more choices and mechanics. A decent bit of strategy going on with this game, how far to hang back your last hinker to get the most resources but not be caught as the last on on the trail. My one major complaint is that there is not enough opportunity to visit the parks, so that if you miss a single one it can put you behind. This makes the end trail position almost no choice, which means not exploring the equipment aspect very much.

The artwork is beautiful and the box and insert are in a class of their own. Just amazing.

all in all a wonderful mid weight game, a step up past the ""gateway"" games level. highly recommend picking up"
6,"Prior to 2020: 0 plays

PARKS is precisely the kind of game that should be in National Parks all across the country - it's filed with a mechanical design and presentation that really works to sell the beauty and accessibility of the national parks themselves, and it's a game that can be enjoyed by just about anyone. There's nothing incredibly new or revolutionary, but the parts that are here work cohesively and fluidly, and the game moves along at a quick pace, ensuring every player is invested in each round and turn. The gameplay is inherently tactical, with players making consideration both of the resources they need and those which they will pass on. Still, there's enough here to warrant some light thinking and occasionally-thoughtful choices, especially as it pertains to racing to the end of a row to acquire a particularly useful reward. The randomness of the card rows can lead to some fairly dull and uninteresting rounds, though, with players having little reason to make big jumps given the relative balance of everything available to them. So while the game is quite strategically shallow due to the lack of interesting long-term trade-offs, it's certainly a game that is well-constructed and pleasant, and it's one that's unlikely to disappoint (or, equally, unlikely to wow) just about anyone. It is a bit long for how light and repetitive it is, but not too terribly so. A fine game that is as much a celebration of the art and parks themselves as it is a game."
5.5,"Gorgeous art (obviously). More decision space than I expected from a linear track, but I'm enjoying it less and less the more I play. Slower turns than Century. Bogs down at 5p. Overlapping goals can be problematic."
10,A gorgeous game. This is the game that got me really into board games and starting my collection. Easy to learn and a lot of fun. Pieces are very beautifully done. Plenty of different strategies and usually pretty competitive.
8,"Beautiful, tactile and can be enjoyed both casually or strategically depending on the mood of the group. Surprising depth is revealed the more games one plays."
9,"Balance mechanism of worker placement, resources management,turn planning, resources control! Love the illustration and fun facts abt the national parks too!"
8,"A fun game, although playing for the first time can be tricky with a rule book that is not the clearest. I’d recommend watching a video tutorial first.
Once you play it once, it’s pretty easy to catch on.

Super cute game.

The rules are a little confusing to learn at first even though the rule book is written well. Ultimately the game is not difficult at all to play."
7.9,Overall I cant deny this is a good game. I just am not always in the mood to play. I think the solo mode is a little lackluster. I love its artwork and how simple it is. It has appeal it just doesnt make it to the table often.
8,I like this game more every time I play it. Not too heavy and amazing art.
8,Fantastic production with some interesting worker placement / set collection mechanics. Love that it ramps up a bit.
6.5,"I’ve only played this with my family, and it’s a pleasant enough family game. There’s nothing really mean that happens, but there is some interaction on what spaces you take. The artwork is great, and choosing what parks you visit and telling the stories afterward is fun. We tend to visit national parks during summer vacation, so researching parks can be a fun follow-up to the actual game.

I got the Nightfall expansion primarily to complete the set of parks. The year cards, in particular, are a big improvement over the base game."
7,Fun and attractive but the luck factor seems a little too high for my taste.
8.4,Great little game with a time track. Lovely artwork. Great components. Small table space. Interesting decisions.

10,"Between the artwork and the gameplay this game is everything I personally look for. Although the setup can seem a little overwhelming at first, both the instruction booklet plus the board itself supports the player throughout their turn."
8,"For a mass produced game, this has top notch components and gameplay."
10,"Majestic. Like the National Parks themselves, this game is an aesthetical retreat from the hustle and bustle of other board games, slowing things down, letting you go at your own pace, and truly enjoying the beauty that surrounds you. But don't go too slow, or you'll miss out on visiting the parks you need to in order to win.

Players take on the role of hikers who traverse a randomized trail of views and vistas, accumulate currency, and use it to purchase admission to a park--visiting it and scoring points. Each player has a pair of hikers they control, and can use them to block opponents--and themselves--from accessing their current space. A once per round ability--the campfire--allows you to share a space for a turn, and strategy comes from deciding when and where to use it. Each round is called a season, and each season brings with it weather which adds additional resources, available to whomever walks down that part of the trail first. You can move as fast or as slow as you'd like, with the advantage being a better selection of parks or upgrades at the end for going fast, and more resources for going slow. Play continues until four seasons have been completed, and the high score wins. There's a mini game of controlling the camera and taking photos from the vista or at the end of the season, as well as a management of canteens which let you manipulate your resources.

Overall, this game achieves a perfect balance between form and function. The art is incredible--with each park having unique art that's worthy of hanging on a wall in it's own right (you can actually buy high resolution prints of these cards), and the components are just fantastic. Wooden tokens, plastic clamshell cases, a metal first player token, robust cards, and high gloss cardboard make this game the best it can be for your buck. It's truly a work of art.

The gameplay is also no slouch, perfectly fitting the theme of wandering through vast parks and being lost in their beauty. You can go at your own speed, taking a longer trip, or race to the finish to ensure you get the parks and items you want. Ultimately, the best strategy is often a mix of both, giving you that feeling of wanting to spend another day on vacation but knowing you have to get back to the real world.

No other game makes me feel the way Parks does, and very few games look as good as it does. Even while writing this, I'm trying to justify ordering a print to fit onto the wall of my game room somewhere. Do yourself a favor a get a copy of this game. 10/10."

This may be the most visually engaging game we own, beating out both Everdell and Tapestry."
6,"If not for the cool theme, I would rate this game lower. For people who like strategy games, the luck factor is too high. It doesn't take long to figure out the strategy, and if all the players are serious gamers who have figured this out, the outcome will be decided by luck: which beginning cards you get, and which cards roll out. The theme is fun, though. However, even though its easy for serious gamers, it's still too complex for family game nights. Non-gamers wouldn't listen to all the rules, and I can see how turns could get dragged out, so I wouldn't really want to play this with non-gamers. All that said, I do enjoy playing this game. I think there are ways to decrease the luck factor, but I doubt I'll have the motivation to implement them."
8,Played for the first time at Level Up Retreat 2024 and then won it in the play to win drawing. Very excited that we won it. The artwork is beautiful for each of the national parks depicted. Love the game mechanics of playing. Still need to look up some game mechanics that were not quite clear in the rule book. Overall would recommend and would play anytime.
8,"Love the casualness, theme, artwork, and mechanics of Parks. Plays a little long at 4+, but i live this one."
6,Played a few times. Was fine. Nothing interesting about the game except for the art. Even with the expansion.
6,"Great flavor, I need to play it a few more times to settle on a score."
7,Moderately light game and a great game night starter. Can play a game in 20-30 minutes and gets the brain pumping.
8,"PROS
- Probably the BEST production I've ever seen. The wood bits, the card quality, the box layout... are all A+! Blown away honestly.
- Rules are very simple, with few icons that need a reference guide. Easy learn, easy teach.
- The art is just simply unmatched. Phenomenal. *insert positive descriptors* LIKE DAMN.
- Fairly simple 'gather resources and buy locations for points' with a good amount of player interaction.

CONS
- Maybe not quite as deep as I'd like, but that's a minor nitpick honestly... This game is a joy."
10,"Have all the expansions. Nightfall is the best, but they're all good. Love this game. Set up takes a minute, but the game itself is very teachable and playable by anyone."
8,"Visit for the art and components; camp out for the gameplay.
Played in: 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019"
5,Nice but could be better. It's more like a beautiful object to have than a real game. Not enough challenges for me
6,"The game is more pretty than intriguing. Nice that its ""meta"" game changes depending on player count."
7,"Cute little game. The art and style elevate the rating by 1 point. Not very engaging, decision making has little impact"
10,"This game is pure therapy. The art is amazing and production value through the roof. I have just looked through the game without playing it because it is so good. The game itself is can be relaxing, but has a really strong competetive component. Even when you are just admiring the views and planning out your next step, you could suddenly be thrown for a lurch when someone else snags the spot you need and you have to scramble to change your plan. There is enough strategy to keep it engaging while you enjoy the game, making it an all around awesome game."
7,Not a bad game. Pretty relaxing. But definitely nothing surprising. Not a single clever mechanism can be found here.
5,Too simple / not exciting - the Trekking games are much better.
7.5,"Needs play for a proper assessment but it looks F'IN GREAT. Seriously, production is off the chain."

8.5,"Really fun, tons of decisions to make and lots to factor in. Very simple action, so quite impressive that the complexity is so high."
8.5,"A beautiful game on the table. The neoprene mat is a must. We played the base game alone and with the Nightfall expansion. The base alone was fun but you can sense the limitations. Nightfall opens up the game. We will not play without it. As you gain experience, the importance of synergies among gear cards becomes evident and establishing what you can as early as you can, cannot be emphasized enough. Although the mechanics of the game are easy to understand, better players will take advantage of opportunities others might miss. Before you know it, you’re being outpaced in park visits and falling too far behind in points. Keep your eyes on gear cards, and make use of the bonus actions on park cards. These stacking actions are key to maximizing visits. The more visits, the more likely you will fulfill year end goals. Yes, there could be a run away victor, but bottomline, this is an enjoyable one hour game, it makes you think, it’s great to look at, and with the expansion is likely to be played often.

1/7/24: Solo mode. What I liked most in solo was the tension presented by the Rangers. Because their movements were to some degree under your control, you could pace your own movements on the trail. The riskier element was how the Rangers would land at the end trail leading to the removal of a Park, one that might have been a target of your own to visit or reserve. The Rangers are antagonists, because your score total at game end places you within a particular range awarding you with a particular title. The real competition then is to improve upon your own score from game to game. This is fine, but for me, a more head to head challenge against an opponent, even an Automa, is more rewarding. Perhaps had the publisher included a score pad, allowing players to record scores, in some imaginative way, then this could enhance the concept of becoming a better hiker over time, as the solo mode emphasizes. I still enjoyed solo and will re-visit. The Ranger concept is unique and keeps play and game flow fun and interesting."

Played once, 2 player

Parks is a fun family game for sure. It feels very reminiscent of games like Splendor and Century, in that it wants you to collect and convert resources in order to get what you need to acquire point cards. In the case of Parks, everything is themed around going for a hike, getting exposed to certain elements (sun, water, trees, mountains) and using those elements to visit various parks.

The action selection mechanism is interesting and changes every round. There's also a special seasonal effect in place every round, which can drive decision making. There are canteen cards that you can use with water tokens to get special effects, and there are gear cards that you acquire by paying sunshine (strange) that will give you some permanent bonus.

The production quality is very high: the artwork is fantastic, nice wooden pieces, and wonderful gametrays to hold the pieces.

If you like games like splendor, or you know people who are outdoorsy types, this would be a great game to introduce them to. It's a solid game that stands on the shoulders of other classics and introduces its own twist on them. Overall, a great little game."
4,"Love the colors, the general theme. That being said, the theme is pretty 'generalized' and doesn't make much sense and the game play itself is fairly lackluster so that theme has to do some heavy lifting."
10,Great game. Light enough that even my wife who doesn't like games enjoys playing it. Theme is awesome and artwork is beautiful.
7.5,This game is fantastic. As per usual with Keymaster Games they have knocked it out of the park with production and light but engaging game play. They are starting to be the gold standard of what publishers should strive for when releasing a game.
8,"Very fun but instructions are a bit vague, after a few youtube videos I was able to figure it out."
6,"Artwork and component quality is fantastic.

Game mechanics and theme are a bit of a mismatch and the teach is a little awkward, but easy enough to understand once the first season is played.

Good light beginner game"
9,"As huge fans of the US National Parks (and National Park Service), we picked up this game simply for the tie-in to one of our other passions. Now, we play this game frequently and often recommend it to friends since the artwork is STUNNING and the box set-up (organizers included in initial purchase) is -hands down- on point.

We purchased and play the Nightfall and Wildlife expansions - but if you're only looking the base game and 1 expansion, we recommend Nightfall."
6,"Cute, light, amazing art and graphic design. Not a lot of game, but a great family or filler game on a theme I adore."
8.1,"2021 Rank: #54 [-11] :: I LOVE THE ART FOR THIS GAME. IT MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY JUST TO LOOK AT IT. THE GAMEPLAY ISN'T THE DEEPEST, BUT IT STILL GIVES YOU INTERESTING DECISIONS. WE JUST GOT THE NIGHTFALL EXPANSION WHICH SHOULD JAZZ IT UP FOR US."
8.5,"Beautiful artwork in a very simple family weight game. Most of the strategy comes from deciding how far to move along the trail, potentially missing out on resources, but also gaining something before other players."
9,"Parks is one of our favorite games. It crosses the divide nicely between a weightier game with plenty of opportunities for strategy and a more accessible theme-centric game for more casual players. I often use it to introduce newer gamers to the next tier of board games, and it's always a hit. The components are beautiful, the storage is amazing, and the gameplay is satisfying and matches the theme wonderfully. There isn't a gamer out there that I wouldn't recommend this to."
,"Originally gave a copy to my sister, then played on BGA with some friends, so I got a copy at PAX Unplugged 2023 through the virtual marketplace!"
,"Pretty game with a great storage setup.

Not a great fan of the designer using an expansion to cover for inadequate playtesting of the base game:

""Every game I design is an opportunity for me to learn more about balance, and yes, there are a few cards whose power levels are little out of whack. We tried to address many of the issues in the new Wildlife expansion.

Park Pass, for example, was over-powered, so we included more opportunities to visit new parks, effectively nerfing Park Pass. On the other hand, the wildlife generators were a bit underpowered, so we made wildlife a super important resource. The photos are also a bit stronger in Wildlife because of the new trail site Memory Cliffs that allows you to discard a photo to gain a bunch of resources.

More generally, we tried to solve the problem of unpopular gear by including a bison that stomps out the gear row, keeping things dynamic and fresh.""

6,"With Nightfall Expansion and Ranger Ron (self printed)

Fun experience, have played solo (Ranger Ron) and with 2P. Beautiful art, dynamic choices, interesting options, etc. This one has rocketed up my list of games quickly. It's not so compact as to be a pub game, which is too bad, but it will get played plenty at home and game days at friend's houses. Looking forward to additional plays.

I took out 20ish of the original parks (based on personal preference) and combined them with all the Nightfall parks (to take full advantage of the instant bonuses) and it all fits in the original box."
7.5,"Resource, photo, and park collection with wonderful wooden components. Nice game that builds complexity with worker placement locations increasing every season."
8,"Excellent game. Excellent artwork and beautiful theme. A little meaner than I expected. Had been described as a relaxing romp, but is more of a strategic blocking race for resources."
6,"Theme and production value are stellar, certainly high points of the game. The rules are somewhat difficult to grasp/teach, though it's not a complex game. A couple mechanics feel disjointed from the rest of the experience, despite having theme-relevant names. Overall a good pick for hikers and National Park lovers seeking a casual strategy game. Doesn't have long staying-power for medium- or big-game lovers."
9,"Good theme, good art, fun game. (Play solo exclusively.)
After 4 plays raised rating to 8.

Raised to 9. Cards are beautiful and gameplay unique and satisfying"
7,Excellent family weight game with stunning components and art. This is a standard setting game for the industry.
8,Dad would like this game. Strategy but chill. Takes 1 hour.
8,Small footprint box holds a lot more strategy then I expected. The beautiful artwork of national parks helps elevate the game.
7,"With updated card backs.
With 3d printed insert holding both expansions in base box."
8,Entertaining beer and pretzels game for people new to gaming. Great graphics and pieces are really nice materials and designs. Nice solo mode playability
7,"I like this game a lot, it's a little too complicated for people that aren't super into games, but really fun with the right crew."
7.5,Beautiful game that looks amazing on the table. Light tactics but they keep the tension at a great level during the game. Perfect game for a relaxed game night.
8,"It’s frustrating that there are often games where there is little opportunity to visit parks, which is the goal of the game. You collect resources up to the max but cannot do anything with them without just shipping to the end of the round. Also irritating is how basically unhelpful towards scoring the bonus cards are, they take more effort and focus than they are worth."
8,"Excellent Condition, comes wit Raccoon promo. Only played once or twice."
7,"The card art is even more stunning in person than online, which is insane, because it's absolutely gorgeous online. The production overall is really, really nice for any game, but especially considering it's available at your local Target. Gameplay is pretty basic but there's enough going on as to not get bored. Not a huge fan of the ""you only get one for the whole game"" concept of the year/goal cards (which I understand is fixed by the Nightfall expansion), and the canteens seem like they could have used their own market or something instead of just a ""draw 1 from the stack"" though I believe that's addressed with a ""draw 2 pick 1"" rule in the Wildlife expansion."
7,Lovely light game and easy to teach. Expansions add some more interesting choices. Plays a little longer than you might like.
8.1,"Such a well-made and aesthetically pleasing game.
Mechanisms are good, making gameplay flow in a timely manner. Artwork is delightful, too.
Great all round game and gaming experience"
9,Very aesthetically pleasing designs and tactile pieces. Interesting strategic gameplay. The rules were a bit confusing and couldve been written more clearly.
9,"Freakin' gorgeous. Turns can sometimes be a little agonizing for a lighter game, and the year cards at the beginning feel a bit imbalanced (I hear an expansion fixes this). But those are my only complaints."
8,"Physical design of this game is astonishingly good. Gameplay is surprisingly good. Very good 3 player game, but doesn’t scale well - lack of tension/competition at 2; overcrowded and slow at 4 and, especially, 5."
9,"August 2020,
Target $49.99

I canceled order.

8,"Packaging and presentation are top notch. Did not find gameplay to be thrilling, but peaceful. The theme of this one carries it along with the art."
8,"+Aesthetics: Gorgeous table presence!
+Thematic Ties: I found the game to be only mildly abstract.
+Replayability: Seems high. A lot of cards were unused in my play.
+Game Arc: Right on the border of long and just right. It plays smoothly. The length of the game is tied to the pace of progression of the players, which also has some strategic implications.
+Complexity: Easy to learn and teach.
+Tactics/Strategy: There is value in paying attention to where your opponent is located and what options they have available to them.
+Storage: Delightful organization in a small box."
7.8,"Great component, and production. I appreciate how they made 12 different animals as wild tokens and gave us 2 trays to keep all the game pieces in. The game is relaxing and enjoyable, the mechanics are good but not impressive. Definitely a family style game! I will give 9 to the components. Will give an 8 with Nightfall expansion which makes the personal goal cards better. Longevity? Not so much."
6.6,"A light collect resources to purchase objective cards game. The puzzle in how to best leapfrog opponents to get the most resources was a good one. However, the random engine card flips were less appealing than say the trade cards in the very similar Century: Spice Road."
,"4 copies -
one copy given to Ethan
one copy given to Ed and Kathleen"
9,"An absolute treasure!
Love playing this game and each play is a very different game with very different strategies every time.
Definitely should be I'm everyone's collection.
The nightfall expansion is kinda a must, the game would be a 10 if NF was built in, but parks as a stand alone falls just shy."
7,"Great game, played once(so far!) with 6 players total with the NightFall expansion. It gave turns more flexibility and variety of options to gain resources and earn points. It feels varied in how players can gain points to win. Game lasted ~1 hour long."
8.5,I have two critiques -- thin out the gear and add a gear churn mechanic... also think the Parks/Gear site should be in the first or second season.
8,Gorgeous production and easy ruleset make this a favorite in our household. Another fantastic offering from Keymaster!
6.5,"Pros: A very attractive game with good art, graphic design, and components. And the two-hikers-and-campfire mechanism is very clever and provides for some interesting interaction between players.
Cons: Despite its chrome, the game is very abstract and gives no sense of visiting parks. The collection of tokens to purchase parks, the canteens, and the gear just make no thematic sense. For a game of this (admittedly low) level of complexity (2.14), it seems like it should have more theming. Trekking the National Parks (a weight of 1.73) actually has more theme, though it's not as strategic. I'm also baffled by the popularity of this game; I think it might be a phenomenon similar to Wingspan..."
6,"*
This game is even lighter than I expected it to be. At heart, it's a simple resource conversion game with a bit of a rondel that's randomized each round. Despite the overall simplicity of the mechanics, it's a beautiful game and a lot of thought went into every aspect of design from the art to the storage. It's also very pleasant to play. Even if the decisions are fairly light, they are still interesting, and the game plays quickly and is quite enjoyable. Little decisions like trying to go for the camera or racing the trail for extra resources, while not hugely impactful on their own, can add up. The art and design bump it up from a 7 to a 7.5. The really nice insert make a quick game play even more quickly because it's so easy to set up and tear down. Have played at 2 so far so it would be interesting to see how blocking it gets with more players.

First solo experience was pleasant and I want to play more. I did score 25 on the first play and felt like I played poorly in the first round so I suspect the BYOS of 30+ won't be very difficult to achieve. Second play I felt like I played much better and scored 29.

Personal objectives are a bit of a letdown - it doesn’t feel like they swing the game much."

8,"Love this game but my husband isn't thrilled with it, so I've mostly played it in solo mode, which is very relaxing. We've only played it together with just the two of us and hope to get a chance to play it with more people since 3 seems to be the ideal number."
10,"The art is amazing, the game play is super fun, the games are always different and every round changes up the strategy."

Excellent art and components. A beautiful game to look at. Easy to learn with some player interaction. A pleasant game to play."
8,Best with 3 players. Not enough traffic on the board with 2 and too much with 4-5.
8.5,"A very relaxing game, played solo or with others, with a soothing theme.
Fast to set up and tear down.
The production, art and storage solution are top shelf quality.
Its very easy to teach, quick to play and small enough to carry in your back pack.
We have the Nightfall expansion, which adds some nice alternative mechanics along with more beautiful cards."
5,"Rating based on 8 plays:

The art and presentation are great, but mechanically it leaves me wanting. I just kind of find myself bored. I also don't like that it seems like the best way to play is to slowly plod away on the trail to maximize your resources. This combined with the fact that the trail gets longer over the course of the game means the game starts to drag more and more for me toward the end. I want to this like this game, but it just feels so meh."
5,"This does not feel like it has enough depth. It feels like Tokaido but with a different theme, and the reason that I fell out of love with Tokaido quickly is that it became pretty clear that the choices were illusory. This one seems to suffer similar balance issues and illusory choices. There's a way to balance this mechanic, but I don't think either Parks or Tokaido manages to make the cost of moving forward high enough to make it worth it."
4,"My play of this started off pretty well. This felt like the thing I wanted Tokaido to be. There is a bit more going on than I expected. About mid-way through it started to drag however. Players were simply moving as slowly as possible down the path making only minor deviations here and there. The game felt long for what it is, and there didn't seem to be any major incentive to finishing quickly though perhaps I could try pressuring the end if I play again. Overall - kind of bleh. Not much of an arc. A bit of a shame as I don't think it's a poor game, though it feels a little lazy and uninspired."
7,"I'm wondering if I would rate this game as highly if it weren't so damn gorgeous. Probably not, but I'm a shallow guy I suppose. Damn does this game look good.

It's for sure the same as Wingspan for me: it's gorgeous, it's a solid-enough game (although a bit light for my tastes), and it's easy to teach with decisions each turn mostly being obvious. Like Wingspan, I'm not necessarily the intended audience, but it's perfect for my National Parks loving wife and the non-gamers in my life.

After a handful of plays, I'll need to get the Nightfall expansion as I've read it'll make the game a tiny bit more interesting for me AND it has those adorable tent pieces."
7,Decent with nice production. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Stone Age or Le Havre.
6,"Borrowed this from the public library. It was good, but I didn't love it. I love the art style but I'm not sure this is something I would repeatedly suggest playing, it's a bit slow for me."
7,"Fast and easy to learn/play. It might wear out its welcome after many repeated plays but as a lighter game that I will bring to the table occasionally or more often with my wife, it fits the bill perfectly."
7,"It was a nice surprise to find this game uses one of my favorite mechanics, one way street. At 3 players it was certainly tight. Yet everything was pretty simple too. Which made it fun for me, but easy to play for my non gaming dad.

The art really is phenomenal. I love that the tiles get shuffled every round. Just about everything in this game is rock solid. Pictures seem a little underpowered though. And I'm not in love with the all or none goals, which I understand they get replaced in the expansion. Insert is another total fail, as it doesn't hold the path tiles correctly.

This was another surprise keep. It went over well and I just love one way street games.

 One way street
 Stunning artwork
 Different path each round
 Good choices between buying gear or visiting parks

 Picture taking seems underpowered
 Two player games should use a dummy player hikers
 Another fail of an insert from this company (they are 0-3)"
8.8,Gorgeous production great at 2 prefer at lower player counts but very fun at every player count. Hopefully the expansion modifies the end of game goals to make them worth while. It's the weakest point in the game
5,"Solid worker placement game. The gameplay honestly deserves to be rated higher, but personally the theme did not speak to me or hook me to want to replay over and over."
7,"The game shares similarity with Tokaido, but I prefer Tokaido as it feels more like a peaceful journey to me (granted it is the most take-that relaxing game I can think of). Parks may actually have the better artwork though. And it has nice wooden tokens and an enamel start player marker. You get so many points from visiting parks and taking pictures, both of which require resources, so it may benefit you to go slowly through the trail to get the most out of it. Though there are the weather water and sun tokens to be claimed by the first person to land on each space, so you are also encouraged to jump ahead. It may also be important to jump ahead to get to a space before someone else blocks it or to claim a park card before someone else does. But usually having more resources is important. It's a pain to work towards paying off a card only to have someone swoop in before you, so it pays to be versatile. But if someone takes a card before you, it will still get replaced, maybe with something even better. I don't pay much attention to the personal goals as they take effort and aren't worth that much. Being start player is advantageous, but as players jump over each other its not as important. But it is worth one point to still be start player at the end of the game. But it's likely not worth rushing ahead to get the start player marker. You can also turn resources into photos at a certain location, and it costs you one resource if you were the last to take a photo and two otherwise, so it pays to keep taking photos, but its also important that other players don't let you keep taking photos back to back. Each player has 2 hiker tokens to move down the trail to collect resources and rewards. You can't land on another space that already has a hiker unless you flip your campfire token, which does give you some interesting choice on when to use it. And you can choose which of your two hikers to move and how far down the trail to jump. When one of your hikers reaches the end of the trail, you reactivate your campfire, and choose to reserve a park, pay for a park, or buy equipment. Equipment is expensive, but its costs are always in sun which is one of the most common resource, tied with water. You can use water to activate canteen abilities and on one of the trail spaces to copy another trail space. The abilities may or may not be worth it. Mountains and trees are the rarest resources. The park prices and points take this into account. There's also times you can trade a resource for a wild, which are represented by unique wooden animal tokens. There's also a random season effect that may make you prioritize some spaces over others. You get so few opportunities to visit parks that you should generally aim to pay for them every opportunity you can, and those wilds help. I felt like luck plays more into Parks than it does in Tokaido. Though you do get lots of choice. And I felt more compelled to hoard resources than to get canteens and equipment, though our scores were all pretty similar at the end of the game regardless of our strategies. The game doesn't feel as thematic of a journey to me as Tokaido either. The artwork is beautiful, but why do I need to collect sun, water, mountains, and trees to visit parks and why can only one player visit a given park? It feels mechanical. It's not a bad game, but I would choose Tokaido over it. There would also be less control with more players, so its better with smaller player counts. I would be more frustrated with park cards getting bought out from under me with more players since getting the resources is even harder then."
6,"It was lovely, but it didn't do it for me. Traded."
8,"A Copy of the Real Thing.

Honestly, I bought it solely based upon how it looked- so beautiful. Makes me want to go outside!

PARKS is leisurely game. Leisure is, ""... not the mere absence of work, but an attitude of mind or soul in which you are able to contemplate and enjoy things as they are in themselves, without regard to their value or immediate utility. Unless we regularly stop work and take time to worship and simply contemplate and enjoy the world- including the fruit of our labor- we cannot truly experience meaning in our lives."" (Every Good Endeavor by Timothy Keller, pg 27-28).

I like that PARKS is not only aesthetically pleasing but also mechanically good given the weight. The depth of strategy is found in using the campfire and timing the two hikers well.

.:Best 3:.

My Notes
I bought it so that I could play with my mom. I normally feel frustrated with people taking too much time on their turn but the game is so pretty and educational! I would say that it is a walk in the park to wait for my turn.

--
Expansion
// Nightfall- fills out the game completing the national parks and adding a night scene. If I'm building a campfire, I'm setting up my tent too. lol"
,"a delightful adventure-adjacent game where you're ""visiting"" state parks from around the country. its got beautiful artwork, and fun mechanics. It's very re-playable, but I recommend playing with an expansion after play 3-4 as you'll have more features to enjoy and re-playability scales up. Recommend both Wildlife and Nightfall, in that order."
4,"Played this at a friend's. My wife enjoyed it, as did the friend's girlfriend (she suggested it). It was decent, but not one that begged for repeat plays. I like the resource management aspect, it felt like an improvement on Splendor."
4,"Very pretty, but not much game here.

Complete lack of any interesting decisions and, as a result, the game length becomes a problem.

If I'd gotten this as an entry game to the hobby I'm sure I'd have enjoyed it temporarily, but now I seek out more challenging and thinky games, this just doesn't bring much to the table. I just don't feel there are ever any interesting or tense decisions. Plenty of other rules-light games provide much more engaging gameplay.

*Rating based exclusively on the 2-player experience as that's all I've played it at."
7,Carried by the beautiful artwork - only playing when I want a visual pick me up
8,Tokaido style of game. However with more interesting decisions. Need to play it a few more times.
8.5,"An amazing backyard patio game. This will never leave our collection.

After 10+ sessions, it got a bit stale, but Keymaster sent us both expansions and we played everything together, which revitalized our love for the game."
5,"Shitty game (at 2p) with great art
Hopefully the expansions make it better"
6,"Not light or short enough for who it is advertised to. Fine game, but bland. Artwork and production is off the charts though. Top 10 all time."
7,A nice heavier version of Trails is the way I see it.
5,This is an extremely generic game with amazing veneer. I feel no emotions when playing this except subdued admiration of the artwork.
8,"2 player, about 60 minutes. Nice chill, relaxing game. Nothing overly complex but satisfying. Good choice selection. A perfect game when you just want something relaxing to play without burning your brain. And absolutely love the artwork. I visited 4 National Parks IRL so this game appeals to me just as it might any other National Parks lover. Oh and the components are insanely good! Best components in any game i own."
6.5,"I love the theme of the game. Mechanics are alright.

Points seem to be incredibly tight, possibly too tight. When I lose it's usually within 2-4 points of the winner. I've even seen a 4 player game where the gap between the winner and the loser was a whopping two points.

I've seen games with a wider spread too, but that's usually with less experienced players.

With scores that tight often, I don't really feel like I lost because I was outclassed or outmaneuvered, really, I feel more like they got slightly more lucky on where the other hiker positions were and what cards were available.

It also feels like I'm already somewhat close to the ceiling for how good I can play the game, which doesn't feel that great considering I've only played a half dozen games.

I haven't played with the expansions, so maybe they loosen the game up a bit more and reward more clever play (and I also enjoy this game more with 2 players than with less, especially since you are a bit less at the mercy of where all the other hikers went).

But I'm not sure there's a whole lot for me to get out of the (base) game with more than 2 players."
8,"Very solid game for up to 5 players. Use your hikers to collect resources and visit parks to score points.

The mechanics of this game are pretty straightforward, and it's presentation is fun with tightly tested gameplay to allow for points even when not visiting parks (i.e photos are worth 1pt each), and strategies to help mitigate costs of parks if you don't have the perfect set of resources for the ones available.

I also must say that the components, trays, cards, and packaging design are the best I've seen come out of a game box. The packaging engineer for this game knocked it out of the park (no pun intended)."
5,7.0 - 2 plays 2 players - A good little game. More tense and cutthroat than I expected. Not sure the turn order track manipulation feels good though. I think for a light game I'd prefer straight set collection to recipe fulfillment. For a quick version I'd take Floriferous.
6,"Gorgeously produced game of visiting national parks in the USA. Worker placement along a flexible track, picking up resources to ""spend"" on national parks.
5 players was too many as everything slowed down.
It's fine, but a pretty standard design."
9,"Great game! Fun to play, easy to learn, very re-playable, and a beauty to behold."
8,"Fun, strategic, not overly complex, a must have to my collection"
9,"This might be my new go to family game. Easy to pick up, beautiful to look at."
8,"Great one-direction worker placement mechanism
Super nice theme
And, my heavens, it is such a beautiful game and so nicely produced."
6,"Fairly simplistic game. Absolutely gorgeous artwork, which makes it much more appealing to play."
7,"The game itself is a fun simple back and forth that is easy to grasp but also very thematic. The art is what keeps bringing me back to this game - it's absolutely gorgeous. I love national parks so that helps, but the design of every piece is so intentional. I do wish there was a little more depth to the game but it is fun enough to keep bringing me back, and I love that others can pick it up easily."
6.3,"Of course the artwork on the Parks cards is gorgeous. What a great way to incorporate the beautiful art of the “The Art of the National Parks” book into a game. The game components are a tactile and visual pleasure. The game plays smoothly and the player choices are interesting. My impression after one game was that strategic decisions were not particularly heavy ones. That seems to be reflected by others in the complexity rating of the game. I also felt that the rules and setup was a bit fiddly initially, but that may have just been a problem for a first time player."
8,"Beautiful game with lovely components. Really well thought out box inlay which adds to the satisfaction.

It is a gentle cosy game with gorgeous art work, yet some challenge in planning ahead moves."
8.3,"Very great worker placement / track advancement game. Of all the nature games I've played so far, this is probably the best I've played so far. The unique thing about this game is the clever self-balanced mechanic where you can take your time progressing down the trail to collect resources but at the same time you want to move your worker at the end of the trail to get the park cards you need. All the while the game is dynamic in terms of the trail tiles, the weather effects, and your starting canteens that can drive your strategy. The artwork in this game is beautiful and the components are fantastic. The resource trays are so well designed, they make the setup and teardown of the game so easy and fast. Fairly light family game with indirect player interaction that's easy going most of the way through however it can get tense closer to the end of the game where the stakes are high where you need to spend the last resources you have to get the cards you need, all the while traversing around the other players."
9,"Beautiful art, interesting gameplay, it's fantastic. Plays great with 3-4 and good with 1-2. 5 runs pretty long and gets crowded/competitive, but it's still fun."
7,Nice simple game to add to the ever-growing outdoorsy collection of games. The trail mechanic with two hikers is genuinely interesting.
10,Played it for the first time after watching a play through video and reading the instructions. Found it easy to understand and fun to play. Looking forward to play with the expansion sets.
7,"Available on BGA

A good welcoming game. A little light for my tastes, but fun to play with people new to the hobby or people who prefer lighter games."
6,"I just wish all board game components & organizations were this good. This game should really set the standard for aesthetics. That being said, simply speaking on the gameplay level, it is just okay. Maybe it will run better at lower player counts, but the trail felt way too crowded for a 4-player game and the resources were not unique enough that I would be looking for specific resources during the game. The game also compensates too much for slow hikers. Wish there was a bigger compensating mechanism for those who wish to race to the end."
8,"Fun and pretty game. Solo play is very enjoyable. Half the fun is the box, no plastic is unnecessary and all trash can fit below the tray/insert if you don't have recycling. Leave PARKS cleaner than you found it!"
8,"Includes Nightfall expansion
Also includes Wildlife expansion and custom 3D printed insert"
,"sleeved w/ Nightfall + Wildlife Expansions + Official Playmat

6.5,"The older brother of Trails, this is a more robust game. The presentation is good, components are great, symbology is pretty clear and the rulebook is pretty straight forward.
The objective cards seemed lackluster and the first expansion, Nightfall, seems necessary.
Many choices and trying to guess where other players will move so that you can get what you want but also optimize your scoring opportunities."
6.8,"Great looking game, but plays too slow at higher player counts"
6,It was very pretty. It's definitely not my kind of game. I wouldn't say the game play was interesting or challenging.
,a very fun starter game! it was very easy to understand!
6.5,"This is a beautiful game that has art that makes it even more engaging. Unfortunately, the game often feels like the second half is dragging as players try to optimize the minimal points they can gain towards the end.
(As a side note, the slowness and the uninspiring point opportunities in the second half are fixed / addressed with the Nightfall expansion that I would never play without.)"
10,"Love when pace of the game is dictated by players. Resource and time management are core challenges.

Some features like canteens and photos seem easily non-essential to strategy, but cute.

Art is, of course, as good as it gets."
9,"A delightful game with streamlined game play, a pleasant amount of decision-making and absolutely gorgeous artwork."
3,"Fairly straightforward game, nice components, for this set collecting game.

The constant blocking by other players made this game pretty bland for me. Although 2 players had next to no points in the first two seasons, they made up for in the the last two to easily walk away with the win (1 point different between 1st and 2nd).

Other than blocking, there is no other player interaction. Did not enjoy playing, and will most likely never play this again.

That being said, it's not a bad game, as euro gamers appear to like the fact that your choices were few, and that you often could not do what you needed to do."
5,"Not bad, for sure. But definitely overrated (and overpriced). The park art is amazing and is carrying this game. I'm not a fan of the line art and color scheme used on the equipment cards, kind of an odd choice."
6,"A very pretty game. Player interaction is entirely in the vein of worker placement: taking the spot or park or gear that someone else wanted. The how to play video from the publisher is very cute as well. Some of the end game scoring cards depend very much on what Parks cards are dealt from the pile. Since there is no way to cycle them, you have to be careful not to get trapped at the beginning of the game."
,"1-5 player
30-60 min
2.15/5 stratagem weight

10,With the play mat and the three exclusive meeples from the jigsaws.
8,"High quality game production goes along way and PARKS is proof of that. Stunning art, amazing wooden game components. The game itself is good, solid worker placement with a movement track that dictates actions and doesn't allow to move back on. Some of the trail actions added are way better than others so games can feel very different depending on what gets added. End game bonuses are kinda boring."
6,"Absolutely GORGEOUS game, one of the most beautiful I own. Really want to like it more. Should give it more chances I guess?"
7.5,Bought for Sheryl for her birthday. Bought from Target on 7/31/2020
9,"Wow, what a beautiful, well-crafted, and genuinely fun game! The components are some of the nicest I've ever seen - solid wood animal meeples, a hefty metal ""starting player"" medal, amazing tarot-sized cards with breathtaking illustrations - and the way all the components fit together in the box is really clever.

I've played the game solo, with 2 players, and 3 players - and it is great with all these combinations. There's a nice variety of ways to earn points, and plenty to think about both on your turn and during your opponents' turns.

I definitely recommend picking this game up, or at least trying it out at your FLGS."
9,"Really well designed game. Simple choices with clear results that still lead to some interesting, difficult decisions. The pace is super quick since you can only ever do 1 thing on a turn and don't need to wait once other players take their turn.

The art is, of course, phenomenal and I love learning tidbits about the beautiful national parks of the US. The game box itself has the best insert I've ever seen for a game without a custom upgrade. Overall just a quality game."
8,I love how this game is clearly built around its theme and artwork. The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. The only reason I didn't give it a 9/10 is that I don't enjoy it quite as much at a 2 player count. But when I've played at a 4-5 player count I think the game really shines.
,"Cards not sleeved.

7,"(Math Trade: Got it for 504 in Fall 2021 - Free Shipping Canadian Math Trade, 2021-10-25)

PARKS is a verry mellow game, similar to Tokaido in many aspects about travelling on a trail and gathering resources until the end of the path where workers can visit parks, buy equipment end so on. Nice family game.

(Sold on 2023-03-16)"
6,"this game looks like it should not work, but it does and does very well. the simplicity of rules paired with depth of strategy is excellent here. I feel the rulebook is a little vague on certain scenarios but its easy enough to pick an interpretation and just go with it. I liked the different ways to achieve victory as well.

Does run a bit long for what it is with certain types of players. Rules are a bit abstract and confusing to non-board gamers and even hobbyist board gamers as well.

One of the great box size : game ratio and one of the great organizers as well. Art and components are fantastic. A really great production and evergreen type game."
7,Playing this game literally makes me want to go on sight seeing adventures. This game is a good challenge yet calming and beautiful! You are literally collecting sights from the different places you explore and getting points for different location components!
8.5,"I like the theme and love the artwork. Games are always tight and the mechanisms correspond to my taste. There's more strategy involved than it might appear at first sight. Gameplay and scoring of base game could be a little more diverse, but the Nightfall expansion fixes this aspect in my book."
9.1,"This is a great game, I feel it is a perfect marriage between Splendor and Tokaido. Though the game is fine the components and gametrays system it comes with are the shining jewel. It refuses to waste my time and space and I appreciate the heck out of that."
7,"1-6, Competitive/Solo, Worker Placement - Visit various location on a trail to collect resources used to purchase souvenirs of national parks"
7,"I like it. I've played it a few times, but I feel like i need to play a few more to really put together a review."
,"Can suffer worker placement aggravation, card stealing, etc.

Very nice components."
5,"Just didn't do it for me but also couldn't put my finger on why it didn't. There didn't seem to be that many interesting choices. The art is undeniable beautiful, just wish the gameplay was better."
8.2,"Great gateway game to entice newbies, but with enough strategy to keep more experienced gamers happy."
8,"High engagement-to-difficulty-curve ratio. Simple, non-offensive theme pairs well with a decent pace. Somewhat lower on the player interaction side, but plays quick enough that it doesn't matter too much."
7,"The beautiful components and relaxing gameplay come together in a really great way. It might not be the most complex game, but I will always want to play."
9,"This game is awesome. Pretty much the perfect level of strategy to make it infinitely replayable while still being easy to learn, and let me tell you: that is a hard balance to strike. My wife and I love it. Excellent for 2 players, have not tried solo yet.

Time to learn: 1 hour. We had to watch some videos, but overall not a terribly painful experience.
Time to play: 30+ minutes.
Setup: 5 - 10 minutes."
7,"This one is popular with guests and hits the table more often than I'd expect. It's a fine game, but I usually prefer something heavier. It's fantastic for what it is though, and the artwork on the park cards is really great. I think my favorite thing is the box itself. Every component has an ergonomically perfect place."
8.5,"An 8.5 with all the expansions. Really charming, smooth, and surprisingly tactical!"
8,"Quite enjoy as a lighter warmup game, and its gorgeous art easily grabs people not otherwise interested in board games"
,Bought this with a gift I received from performing a funeral for a very dear friend (Lucy).
7.5,"An entry-level streamlined game about collecting resources and spending them to ""visit"" national parks. The art, board, and cards are extremely gorgeous. I originally thought there was not much of a game here and it would be similar to Tokaido. But there is actually a decent amount of decisions to be made here: collecting resources, claiming parks, and whether to go slow or fast to the end. Excited to see what the expansion brings to the game."
6.8,Much more tension and decision-making in this game than would seem with such simple rules. Pleasantly surprised.
7.7,Gaming: a nice set collection game. A little long at higher player counts.
,"With the exception of the colors of the pawns (They're pastels. I dislike pastels.), this is a gorgeous production. Otherwise, this is just another worker placement/set collection game."
7,"The gorgeous art, theme, and production really elevate this game. Gameplay is good, but can drag on a bit for such a light game. Good entry/family game to introduce to friends and family."
7,"Another simple collect-goods-and-fill-orders-for-points game like Splendor and such, in a nice compact package. The hikers on the track is a good mechanic (though not a new one) which adds a bit of push-your-luck tension to the position you take, and keeps the game moving forward. The canteens and gear cards give players a way to customize their own gameplay and are simple and fun. Thematically, collecting water and sunshine and trading it in for parks is a little silly, but the artwork is polished and diverse, yet cohesive - I like the idea of having so many artists involved on a single project."
9,"A fantastic family game, with amazing components and art! In this game, you visit the American national parks and take photos (collect resources on your path to visit the parks; gear and canteen cards will help you). Did you reach your hiking goals at the end of the year? It plays very well solo!"
10,"I like this game! It takes the general gameplay of Tokaido but mixes it with a Hiking Theme. Great at 2 players, feels like a nice chill hiking simulator then, played with 4 and its more of a funny cutthroat competitive game."
7.5,Tokaido killer for me. Same laid back feel with what feel like more interesting decisions to me. Having two hikers instead of one traveler is another big improvement. Beautiful art + one of my favorite inserts ever.
6,"Theme courtesy of Tokaido, mechanics courtesy of Splendor-meets-Egizia...

I don't mean to sound at all disparaging. Parks is a very pleasant combination of familiar mechanics, a very easy teach, and a wonderful theme.

Instant winner."
7,It’s ok but a little dull. I prefer the atmosphere of Tokaido.
6,"The major issue is first player - way more important than in most games and hard for the person in last place to regain the first player token.

A bit unexciting, you reach a point where everyone is playing their own game and not paying attention to the other players and the beautiful tokens lose their thematic hook and start to feel interchangeable due to round-specific powers and purchased upgrades (the Gear)."
9,Might be the prettiest game I've ever seen. It's also fun to play.
7,"It’s a fun game, with enough strategy mixed with nice art and a simple gameplay layout that it’s great for a variety of groups. Not heavy enough for my tastes personally, but the production and game are great."
7,"An expanded version of Trails (we came into the series backwards, I know), nails a theme that we love (hiking and the national parks)in a breezy Ratchet style game. The artwork is great as is the commitment to the theme, and the gameplay is perfectly good."
9,"Includes Nightfall expansion, Wildlife expansion, playmat, Tantrum season promo, and promo animals."
9,"Interesting set of decisions, and it doesn't hurt that the components are wonderful.
Tags: Keep, Accessible"
8,This is a gem. Great gameplay with engine-building and great competition on the trail. Beautiful production. This a great after-dinner game that won't wreck the night.
7,"My biggest complaints are that the game always feels too short (not necessarily bad) and the bonus cards don't feel impactful enough for how difficult they can be to achieve. The Nightfall expansion adds some content that improves my complaints with the game, but I hate reaching for another box when setting up the game.

I think it's most enjoyable at 2 player as a cozy game. It gets more difficult (competitive) with more players as it seems harder to accomplish things.

I don't like the BGA implementation and won't play on there. If you've tried it there and didn't like it, don't give up on it entirely!"
8,"What a fun, quick game with a good amount of strategy for a victory point game. It has a little worker placement combined with some engine building with the canteen cards. I don't love or dislike the theme, but the theme really does work in this game. I would suggest this for a not too heavy but fun game."
8,"Great components and beautiful artwork really help make the game, and are a hallmark of Keymaster Games. The game is crunchier than the size of the box would let on, but still crunchy enough for most gaming hobbyists, a worker placement with a ratcheting mechanism that offers good options with the expansion. I usually play with 2, but scales well up to 4; best at 3."
9,"Easily the most beautiful game I own. I love showing this to people, even those who don't like games! And its a great game for when I want to play a game like Viticulture but don't have the time."
7,"1/10/22: Played many times at a variety of player counts.

Good: Beautiful production, love the fun facts about the parks on the cards, and I like the one-way rondel gameplay. Really good to show new people.

Bad: Gets stale after many plays, and there are some questionable graphic design decisions with some of the icons."
7,"This game is stunningly beautiful, with its lovely artwork and laser-cut animal tokens. Its brilliant storage lets it pack lots of punch in a small box. I personally find the applications of the theme very confusing and unintuitive, but I still enjoy the game a lot. The last-goes-next mechanic reminds me of Tokaido or Nova Luna. I like the set collection element, and the fact that the trail (game track) changes randomly with each round. Gameplay can drag a bit but it’s still interesting. I recommend everyone try it out."
7,"Surprised at how much thought actually goes into your movement in this game, which thought bumped it from my assumed 7 to an 8 after first play.

After 2nd play, wished for more viability in Gear cards and variety in Canteens. Back to 7."
7,"The board design and components for this game are so freaking good. They are SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD

- little wooden animal pieces: LUV EM
- pretty card art: LUV IT
- little wooden pieces in general: HOT
- tasteful desaturated pastel ish color scheme: YEAH BABEEEEEY

The theme is uhhh just ok, I like placing the weather tokens on the board but buying parks is kinda weird. But overall this is my go-to gateway game compared to say Wingspan for friends who wanna move past staples like Catan or easy lightweight family games like Azul.

I've seen this game around and played this for the first time at a friend's, which has now set off the very latest mass acquisition of board games once I discovered that the UK has a crazy secondhand market due to crazy cheap shipping that just doesn't exist at all in Canada"
8,"Wife likes this one more than me, but it sure is a looker. I will very likely never turn down a play."
,Returned unopened and untried. Impulse clearance buy. Love the theme and production quality but hesitant to keep because I disliked Tokaido and prefer some crunch in my games.
8,A really surprisingly-fun take on Tokaido that really works well. Easy to introuduce to others and the component quality really makes it stand out. Excellent 1-5 option.
8,"Nice, easy going and relaxed game for a family game night."
10,"Parks is an excellent game. The actions you get to do with your workers/hikers are all fun, but also straight forward. There are lots of strategies to win, and can change based on the secret objectives you get. The game components are incredibly high quality and the art on the Parks cards is absolutely stunning. One of my favorite games and it hits the table often."
8,"An awesome collection game with some of the best artwork that I have ever seen. Nice, lightweight, travels well and plays pretty quickly. I really love this game."
7,"Fantastic production and gorgeous artwork. Can be a bit mean, but it's fun."
8,"8 rating for solo play. High score 29 (updated 1/6/23) after solo 10 plays.

KEEP"
,"Beautiful game where you hike, visit national parks, collect resources, and take pictures in a board game! visiting parks costs resources and gets you points and every picture you take is worth points. try to have the most points at the end of the 4th hike (1 hike per season)

for 1-5 players, probably takes 20ish mins to learn as it is a bit hefty, game probably takes at least an hour

good game for game night if we split up"
4,"2023/01/01: For some reason this falls flat for me. The artwork is beautiful but gameplay really doesn't do anything for me. The playthrough seemed pretty mechanistic. This is based on one play, so maybe I'm missing a lot."
8,Parks is very reminiscent of Tokaido. It’s easily a favorite game and I love the way that the turns take place. It does have moments where it is relaxing but it can also be a bit more competitive than other games like it.
7.7,"Really enjoyable, don't want to play at more than two that would make the game frustrating and stressful which doesn't fit the theme. Theme comes through beautifully in the game and that is helped by some lovely components."
8,"Initial rating with the following caveats:
- I've played six games. Base game only and 2P each time.
- I have Nightfall but haven't incorporated it yet.
- I'm Canadian. Even though I've visited numerous US national parks, my heart just doesn't swell with national pride playing this game as it might for an American.

Production, artwork, quality, etc. just amazing. Game is fun and can get tense at times. Light gameplay, but highly enjoyable. All of our games have been close - within a point or two of each other despite different strategies. A sign of a well balanced game? Or maybe just a point salad where everyone can be a winner? Not sure yet.

Can't wait to incorporate Nightfall and get more games in."
9,"I love Parks because I feel like its a palate cleanser and very chill. After playing Aeons End, Spirit Island or Scythe, and I feel this is a good game to follow up with. Just relaxing, easy to set up and not the most brain power, and that is a compliment."
10,Received this from a secret Santa. Can’t wait to play it tomorrow for Christmas with family. I’m already a huge fan of Henry as a designer and I know they will be as well. ❤️
8,Great game. It also has the best insert and condenses the game down to the smallest package of any game I own.
6,"Original rating - 7
6.5 - 3/2022
6 - 12/2022

A relaxing game, possibly too long for what it is (with 4) and too little decision making. It still is a fun game that anyone can play."
6.5,"What sets Parks apart is it's absolutely phenomenal art, packaging, and theme. I would happily buy this just to have it on my shelf.
The gameplay is nothing exciting or new, but offers a polished worker placement experience that would do nicely as a gateway to the genre. Personally I wish objectives and abilities were less random and allowed for more strategy, but even so this game is a wonderful ambassador to the hobby for non-gamers."
9,"Loved it and can't wait to give it another go now that I fully understand it. Similar to furnace in some respects, which I also really enjoy. Easy to learn as well."
7,"2.15 Complexity
Upgraded Insert + Stickers
Beautiful Production, was enjoyable, but didn't quite hit that awesomeness level I was aiming for.
Heard it was much more strategic with NightFall will have to try it with that!"
6,Beautiful game with nice components. It's another game where actions are chosen in a sequence similar to a rondelle (which I strongly dislike in games). It is mitigated a bit though by being allowed to go to the same place as someone else occasionally. The paths to victory contain fun choices.
7,"Decent game. I enjoyed it and would play again. But I probably wouldn't be the one to suggest it. I would rather play splendor over this.
I'm really surprised this had made it up to 118th as of 2/2022.

Update: played again and had a really good time. Simple but fun with kids and I like the interactions and blocking."
7,Enjoy this game! Very beautiful game and the gameplay is solid.
4,"If our actual national parks were this boring, they'd have been turned into golf courses a long time ago."
8,"A wonderful game! Components are more than amazing, It is a mass market available game at many stores. Gateway game for gamers to get into the modern board game hobby. Highly recommend any newcomers to try and definitely a fun set collection game for anyone to give a go."
6,It was nice and I would play it again. Some small design items made this not a keeper.
9,"Another easy to learn, hard to master game. The artwork sucked me in. Fun theme! Definitely recommend the Nightfall expansion to go with the base game! (Get a Parks game mat if you can.) You won't regret it!"
5,"Average - take it or leave it.

First play of the game and it was fine. Nothing in the game really stood out as a challenge or reason I would want to play the game again right away. The production value was outstanding and I am a sucker for the national parks poster art style highlighted in the game. In the end, I'll gaze at the posters in my house and save my game time for something more challenging.

8,Great art on this game - feel like the game is a little different every time with some fun change ups offered.
7,"Ridiculously gorgeous artwork. When combining the art, the resource trays, the way the box is packed, and the quality of the components, this is probably the single best-produced game in my collection. Very easy rule set to learn. Every family should own this.

I am dropping the rate to this a little--only because the resources and points are distributed too symmetrically for my tastes. What I mean is that the resources and points are so perfectly balanced (i.e. sun = water = 1/2 point, mountains = trees = 1 point) that it feels like the choices are pretty much identical. This leads to the feeling that the choices aren't meaningful. Every game of this I've played has a final score in which players are within 2 points of each other. On the one hand, this normally feels really cool, but not for PARKS because it feels like any choice you make will lead to the same result, which is decidedly NOT cool. I need to play the game, though, at a larger player count--maybe that feeling will go away."
7.8,"Beautiful, beautiful game on the table and a lot of fun."
8,Love the art. Engaging game. Biased because I've been to some of these parks and the nostalgia is strong.
7,"Best art and production of any game I ever played. The gameplay is breezy, yet meaningful. I'm really looking forward to many more plays of this."
8.5,This game has a good integration of theme within it mechanics. Its a worker placement race game with some light resource management. A great family game that has some great information on national parks.
4,"If my score were based on looks, then it would be a 10 - very pretty cards & excellent components. Unfortunately, the gameplay leaves me absolutely cold. The game is repetitive and overlong."
7.9,"Enjoyed my first play (2p) this one seems a little more complicated than it really is. The teach is a little fiddly, lots of moving parts, but ultimately the theme ties most of it together and it is more digestible than it seems. It obviously isn't super heavy, but family gamers would feel overwhelmed reading the rule book I expect. I have not played tokaido or other similar games, always thinking I wouldn't enjoy them. I was wrong. This game has light engine building with gear cards, and the additional trail tiles each road add up to a game with a great snowball effect, really good momentum. I do feel like this game could have lost one module for the sake of simplicity, as it feels like there are expansions already included. That said, great game, and easy learn for seasoned gamers, and a good next step for those new to the hobby. Update, played again at 3, which is better than 2p, I upped my rating. I do worry about replayability. Despite the many random card drawing each game is likely fairly samey."
6.5,"Some of the best artwork in boardgames, but the less-than-intro friendly rules compounding with the expanding of each season makes the game overstay its welcome."
9,"In 2021 I went to the family Christmas party for the first time in well over 10 years. My brothers and I thought it would be fun to load up the Yankee Swap with board games. Perhaps someone would get one and want to play, which would create a way to communicate without talking about ourselves endlessly.

My brother Winston got this one on a whim and my Uncle Kevin got it swap. He immediately ridiculed it and we realized our plan was going to be a bust. We figured these outdoorsy people would love an outdoorsy game. When it came to me I opened an Alexa and ridiculed the technology and opted to take Parks in favor of analogue fun. It turned out to be one of my favorite games and I've gone out of my way to get every expansion."
9,"It would be very difficult for me to overstate what a great game this is. First things first, Parks is simply an amazingly beautiful game. The artwork for the cards is stunning. That alone makes it worth at least a try. As for game play, it can seem simplistic at first, but that first impression belies the true depth of this game. It's a very tight, very well designed game that's easy to teach/learn, and plays fairly quickly. The insert for the base game is fantastic and holds everything perfectly. It's very obvious where each part goes. It also comes with two included custom bit trays that work great and are even shaped in theme for the game. My only issues are that the original insert does not work with sleeved cards, and that, with both Expansions, the whole game will not fit into the base game box."
7,"PARKS is very pleasant and lovely to look at, but just not that interesting after playing 2 or 3 times."
10,The additional complexity and breadth of options introduced by Wildlife and Nightfall took a game I already adored and turned it into something even more special.
9,What an outstanding game! Beautiful artwork and design and an extremely engaging theme. The quality of the components is just exceptional. This is such a terrific game for those who are ready to move from gateway games to slightly heavier options.
6,Decent light to mid weight engine builder. Visually beautiful if that’s your thing. Overall I like this better than wingspan and would put it in a similar list of games.
7.1,"Simple one way ratchet game with resource management. Love the art here, and it's a good intro game for non-gamers"
4,"I like the one-way-street mechanism, and how it is used in this game. I think the different powers you can gain are solid, and there are some decent decision-points along the way. It's annoying that there aren't many spaces on the track, particularly at the beginning of the game, because it feels like you don't have many options about what to do if you are late in the turn order. But more frustrating is just the length of the game. We didn't even play the last round of our game because the first 2 rounds took hours. With less players this might be worth the time, but at 4 or 5 it's a total no-go."
8,"Is pretty and relaxing, play it with outdoorsy types and they'll have something to say about every other location XD"
4,Really didn't vibe with this game. Not sure why it is so popular.
8.5,"Extremely charming with good gameplay to boot, this game is essential for any National Parks traveler. The components in this game are better than any I've ever seen, from the unique card art to the wildlife tokens all being different. The gameplay is interesting and variable, with no two rounds being the same. The only issue I have is that the objectives are pretty inconsequential and can be a trap if you go too hard for them."
9,"Fantastic family game! Beautifully illustrated, easy to teach, and doesn't take too long. Looking forward to more plays."
6.2,It's a bit chaotic and long for what I get out of it.
6,"Linear progression along a track collecting resources to then allow Park visits. Some clever elements mean that you have to play based on where opponents are positioned on the track.
Feels that something is missing to provide that drive to want to play again."
7,"Very nice game, light but yet very satisfying game to play!"
6.6,"A track-movement, contract fulfillment game about hiking in the nature. Hikers should visit different natural monuments, by paying the price underneath each card. In their trail, there's a modular track which shows which actions they can take. Nice components. I love how wild tokens each depict actually a different wild animal. Overall, a gorgeous-looking pleasant game."
7,"Traded away in August 22 maths trade. Lovely art, obviously, this drew me to it, but I found the gameplay quite weak. Not so good as a solo, and when I have played with others it has seemed to drag, for what it is."
6,"A pleasant game that was way lighter than I expected, given how much I've heard people rave about it. Would happily play again but I have plenty of other fillers I'd rather play and the beautiful artwork and quaint theme just don't quite elevate it to the type of game I feel the need to own."
6.5,"Parks from a production standpoint is a masterpiece. The art is stunning, the components are spectacular,and the Game Trayz make setup/cleanup a breeze. This is how every game should be produced even with the inevitable increase in MSRP. So with that in mind, why am I lower on this game then most? If you strip away all the amazing production value, I'm just not sure this is a ""great"" game. I think it's just a ""good"" game. Parks is a very simplistic worker placement game of grabbing resources and then using them to visit a park. It's very easy to get resources without being blocked in lower player count games. The game seems to play better at higher player counts as getting the parks/resources you want become more challenging. Parks is a chill experience, but I wonder how many times I can get it to the table before this simplistic game becomes stale."
2,They changed the back of the cards and won't make a valid effort to help replace them.
8.1,"This is a pretty, and seemingly-relaxing game that deceptively masks how competitive it can really become, every time you play...

With only two hikers per player, players compete to reserve, visit, and gain points from some truly spectacularly drawn/represented national parks across the United States.

As said above, though, what looks like a fairly relaxed trek through the beautiful land/seascapes turns into a complex session of planning-ahead/resource management, as players scrounge-up opportunities left and right for eventual dominance.

Even despite this style of play, the information therein, as well as the advertising provided, is a loud and proud endorsement for the National Parks Service. Go visit our natural beauty, folks!"
8,"This is an excellent family game. Especially for families like mine that love to camp. It takes a little bit of teaching because it is a bit complicated for people who have maybe only played Monopoly. This is an excellent gateway game. The artwork is stunning, the rulebook is fine. After one playthrough, everyone has a grasp on it and subsequent playthroughs are nice and competitive. This is a hard recommend for me."
9,"Beautiful resource collection game. This is one of my favorites. Everything about it feels great to me. If you have ever played the game UnEarth, this feels like a more complicated form of that. Might take a little time to learn for new-to-board-game players. I still highly recommend though."
6,"Beautiful, innovative and thematic........however, this game is just not clicking with me. I never seem to have the right stuff for the parks that come out, and when I do, I get beaten to them, leaving me with resources that don't quite work. Taking lots of photos as a back up doesn't work to get enough points to make a difference. I find that I do the best when I don't plan, gather as many resources as I can, and hope to visit the parks as they come out. Chaotic and more tactical than strategic. 5, maybe 6 stars."
7,"Players: 1-5 [3]

Chill game with some interesting decisions but goes on a little too long. Maybe the expansion will help."
8,Love the artwork in this game. Great components. A lot of player interaction.
10,"Absolutely phenomenal game. Have most likely play ~40-50 times at this point. The first game we usually pull out, and constantly return to it.

Gameplay - simple enough for anyone to pick up on quickly, but complex enough to challenge seasoned gamers. Low floor, high ceiling. Its gameplay is unique, and constantly changes when you add or subtract people from the game. At two player, it feels like a race, who can get the resources they need first to get the parks and take the pictures they need. At 5 players, every point, every resources, every spot becomes so vital.

Pieces - This game is incredibly gorgeous. From the wooden pieces, to the intricate art pieces on each of the parks, this game is not merely fun to play, but beautiful to look at. The game feels quality, and you can't but help feel a sense of joy as it packs away so neatly. No pieces jostling inside the box, its secure and compact.

Final Thoughts - This game will be a lifelong favorite of mine. I cannot wait to grab the expansions and add more complexity and depth to an already amazing game."
7.5,"Very pretty, and relaxing puzzle, but isn't exciting enough for me to keep."
7.8,"simple game that's easy to teach and fairly fast to play, beautiful artwork and nice components"
5,"Eh... it's fine. But nothing actually interesting going on in this game. Collect some tokens, cash them in for points, rinse, repeat. Whoever the force of chaos shines upon will eke out a victory by a point or two."
6.8,"This is a more interesting Tokaido, where you follow a path to collect resources to buy cards (gear or parks). Played this and saw some super card combos allowing large grabs. I'd like this game except the cock blocking is extreme and very frustrating, and this is deliberately built into the game. No interest in owning this because of that. Will play this, but not if I have a choice of friendlier games."
7,I enjoyed my first solo play. Laid back and not intense at all - at least solo. Another I want to try with a group.
7,"Not worth the hype. The game has amazing art, don't get me wrong. Besides that, the game mechanic is decent and the theme is clever, but it's too long and drawn out for what it gives. I don't mind complex games but this is unnecessarily more complicated to be enjoyable. TRAILS is a much better game in my opinion."
6,"Played first time at d20 board game cafe in Watford, UK"
6,"Okay game with great art. I think this game probably deserves more than my rating says, but for me this game just never grabs me much. Slightly too long for what it is to me as well. IU will give it a lot of credit for being inviting and yet interesting enough to be a great game for showing non-gamers what non-mass market games can be. That being said, i think Summer Camp and Planted both fit that spot better for me."
8,"The central mechanic of hiking the trail provides a good decision space of when to move ahead and when not to. Tends to be very tight and points are at a premium. Gorgeous artwork, components, and presentation."
7,"Very nice ""path"" game. Aesthetically pleasing. Some tension in that you never feel like you are going slow enough down the paths... but ended up scoring better than I thought I would."

9,"08-2021 - modified the insert to accommodate sleeved cards (see my DIY thread for more info).

10-2021 - added stickers to wooden components to further deluxify them."
8,"PARKS is a fun, light-weight, worker-placement, and resource management game with beautiful artwork and components. Even with the Nightfall expansion included, PARKS plays quickly and cleanly making it easy to teach and highly accessible to both new and experienced gamers."
,"Played on BGA, but haven't got the physical copy to the table yet."
5,"I want to talk about how awesome the artwork is (it’s truly lovely). But all I can really say about the gameplay is that there's lots of downtime at higher player counts, incidental and minimal interaction, and a resource-churn for points that cuts me off from what I want to be a thematic, naturalistic experience. But there’s no nature here outside the gorgeous art. The gameplay is all synthetic and mechanical.

What else? 30-60 minutes is comically optimistic at higher player counts, and 30 minutes feels criminally misleading at any count. It shares a bit of movement mechanics with Tokaido, which is more narratively coherent by an order of magnitude, is half as difficult to teach, and is possessing of the same pastoral warmth upon completion of the journey. If this is a high-ranking family game, either my definition of a family experience or BGG's is skewed from the norm. This is a light-to-medium engine-builder for Eurogamers, which is no sin, but doesn't generate the types of jovial interactions I associate with family memories.

Player count matters a lot. The bone I'll throw it is that it's a pleasant experience at 2P, and probably fine at 3P, but becomes torturous at 4-5P. Adjust your interest accordingly."
8.5,"Love this one! The art pulls you in, makes for a very relaxing weeknight game that isn't too thinky, but still requires careful planning. The Nightfall expansion makes it even better!"
7,"A pretty good resource management game, with beautiful artwork. Simple rules, very easy to teach, a good family game."
6,Must work on private bonuses right from the start of will not complete.
